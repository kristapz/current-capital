        "1.4. Classic Issues in Finance returns Rmv must be expressible as 19 Rmv Rf a Rm Rf for some number a. 5. Since each point on the mean-variance frontier is perfectly correlated with the discount factor, we must be able to pick constants a , b , d , e such that m  a  bR mv , Rmv dem. Thus, any mean-variance efficient return carries all pricing information. Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa. 6. Given a discount factor, we can also construct a single-beta representa- tion, so expected returns can be described in a single-beta representation using any mean-variance efficient return except the risk-free rate,  ERiRf i,mv ERmvRf . The essence of the beta pricing model is that, even though the means and standard deviations of returns fill out the space inside the mean- variance frontier, a graph of mean returns versus betas should yield a straight line. Since the beta model applies to every return including Rmv itself, and Rmv has a beta of 1 on itself, we can identify the factor risk premiumasERmv Rf. The last two points suggest an intimate relationship between discount factors, beta models, and mean-variance frontiers. I explore this relation in detail in Chapter 6. A problem at the end of this chapter guides you through the algebra to demonstrate points 5 and 6 explicitly. 7.

The priced part is perfectly correlated with the discount factor, and hence perfectly correlated with any frontier return. The residual or idiosyncratic part generates no expected return, so it lies flat as shown in the figure, and it is uncorrelated with the discount factor or any frontier return. Assets inside the frontier or even on the lower portion of the frontier are not worse than assets on the frontier. The frontier and its internal region characterize equilibrium asset returns, with rational investors happy to hold all assets. You would not want to put your whole portfolio in one inefficient asset, but you are happy to put some wealth in such assets.",

Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM The CAPM, credited to Sharpe 1964 and Lintner 1965a, b, is the first, most famous, and so far most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the wealth portfolio. The function is linear, m abRW . t1 t1 a and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1  EmRW  and 1  E m R f . For example, see equation 8.3. In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, SP500, etc. The CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,  ERi W ERW. i,R This section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutilityRW here,andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor. I present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead. The CAPM is the model m  a  bRw; Rw  wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by 1 two-period quadratic utility; 2 two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; 3 infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; 4 log utility.",

However, since we want a connection to the beta representation based on covariances rather than second moments, it is easiest to fold means of the factors in to the constant, and write m  a  b  f with Ef   0 and hence Em  a. The connection is easiest to see in the special case that all the test assets are excess returns. Then 0  EmRe does not identify the mean of m, and we can normalize a arbitrarily.

Let us ask the converse question: suppose we have an expected return-beta model such as CAPM, APT, ICAPM, etc. What discount factor does this model imply? I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work.

The payoffs are typically returns or excess returns, including returns scaled by instruments. The prices are typically one returns, zero excess returns, or instruments. To implement GMM, we need to choose a set of moments. The obvious set of moments to use are the pricing errors, g bETxfbp. T This choice is natural but not necessary. You do not have to use p  Emx with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p  Emx. You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p  E mx . It is a choice, and the results will depend on this choice of moments as well as the specification of the model.

        "78 5. Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations 5.1 Expected Return-Beta Representations The expected return-beta expression of a factor pricing model is ERii,aa i,bb . The model is equivalent to a restriction that the intercept is the same for all assets in time-series regressions. When the factors are excess returns, then a  E  f a . If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero,   0. Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form ERii,aa i,bb , i1,2,...,N. 5.1 The  terms are defined as the coefficients in a multiple regression of returns on factors, Ri a  fa  fb i, t 1,2,...,T. 5.2 tii,ati,bt t This is often called a time-series regression, since one runs a regression over time for each security i. The factors f are proxies for marginal utility growth. I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9. For the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f  consumption growth, or f  the return on the market portfolio CAPM. Notice that we run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt about predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in good times or bad times as measured by the factors. The point of the beta model 5.1 is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i  1, 2, . . . , N in 5.1 to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in 5.1 are the explanatory x variables, which vary asset by asset. The  and common for all assetsare the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation 5.1 says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all ERi,i pairs to line up on a straight line with slope  and intercept  . i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and a is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure.

You do not have to use p  Emx with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p  Emx. You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p  E mx .

Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM The CAPM, credited to Sharpe 1964 and Lintner 1965a, b, is the first, most famous, and so far most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the wealth portfolio. The function is linear, m abRW . t1 t1 a and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1  EmRW  and 1  E m R f . For example, see equation 8.3. In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, SP500, etc. The CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,  ERi W ERW. i,R This section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutilityRW here,andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor. I present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead. The CAPM is the model m  a  bRw; Rw  wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by 1 two-period quadratic utility; 2 two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; 3 infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; 4 log utility.",

This observation motivates efforts to tie the discount factor m to other data. Linear factor pricing models are the most popular models of this sort in finance. They dominate discrete-time empirical work. Factor pricing models replace the consumption-based expression for marginal utility growth with a linear model of the form mt1 abft1. a and b are free parameters. As we saw in Chapter 6, this specification is equivalent to a multiple-beta model ERt1    , where  are multiple regression coefficients of returns R on the factors f , and  and  are free parameters. The big question is, what should one use for factors ft1? Factor pricing models look for variables that are good proxies for aggregate marginal utility growth, i.e., variables for which uct1 uct is a sensible and economically interpretable approximation. More directly, the essence of asset pricing is that there are spe- cial states of the world in which investors are especially concerned that their portfolios not do badly.

The model is equivalent to a restriction that the intercept is the same for all assets in time-series regressions. When the factors are excess returns, then a  E  f a . If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero,   0. Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form ERii,aa i,bb , i1,2,...,N. 5.1 The  terms are defined as the coefficients in a multiple regression of returns on factors, Ri a  fa  fb i, t 1,2,...,T. 5.2 tii,ati,bt t This is often called a time-series regression, since one runs a regression over time for each security i. The factors f are proxies for marginal utility growth. I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9. For the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f  consumption growth, or f  the return on the market portfolio CAPM. Notice that we run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt about predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in good times or bad times as measured by the factors. The point of the beta model 5.1 is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i  1, 2, . . . , N in 5.1 to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in 5.1 are the explanatory x variables, which vary asset by asset. The  and common for all assetsare the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation 5.1 says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all ERi,i pairs to line up on a straight line with slope  and intercept  . i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and a is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure.

We will see similar special cases in the remaining theorems: the manipulations only work for discount factor choices that do not imply zero or infinite risk-free rates.

Equation 6.12 shows that the factor risk premium  can be interpreted as the price of the factor; a test of   0 is often called a test of whether the factor is priced.

Note that the factors need not be returns though they may be; they need not be orthogonal, and they need not be serially uncorrelated or conditionally or unconditionally mean-zero. Such properties may occur as natural special cases, or as part of the economic derivation of specific factor models, but they are not required for the existence of a factor pricing representation. For example, if the risk-free rate is constant, then Etmt1  is constant and at least the sum b ft 1 should be uncorrelated over time. But if the risk-free rate is not constant, then Etmt1  Etbft1 should vary over time."

Still, it is in some sense the only model we have. The central task of financial economics is to figure out what are the real risks that drive asset prices and expected returns. Something like the consumption-based modelinvestors first-order conditions for savings and portfolio choicehas to be the starting point. Rather than dream up models, test them, and reject them, financial economists since the work of Mehra and Prescott 1985 and Hansen and Jagannathan 1991 have been able to work backwards to some extent, char- acterizing the properties that discount factors must have in order to explain asset return data. Among other things, we learned that the discount factor had to be extremely volatile, while not too conditionally volatile; the risk-free rate or conditional mean had to be pretty steady. This knowledge is now lead- ing to a much more successful set of variations on the consumption-based model. 455",

The equivalence theorems are obviously important to the theme of this book. They show that the choice of discount factor language versus expected return-beta language or mean-variance frontier is entirely one of convenience. Nothing in the more traditional statements is lost. p  Emx is Innocuous Before Roll 1977, expected return-beta representations had been derived in the context of special and explicit economic models, especially the CAPM. In empirical work, the success of any expected return-beta model seemed like a vindication of the whole structure. The fact that, for example, one might use the NYSE value-weighted index portfolio in place of the return on total wealth predicted by the CAPM seemed like a minor issue of empirical implementation. 121"

        "152 9. Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM The CAPM, credited to Sharpe 1964 and Lintner 1965a, b, is the first, most famous, and so far most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the wealth portfolio. The function is linear, m abRW . t1 t1 a and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1  EmRW  and 1  E m R f . For example, see equation 8.3. In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, SP500, etc. The CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,  ERi W ERW. i,R This section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutilityRW here,andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor. I present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead. The CAPM is the model m  a  bRw; Rw  wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by 1 two-period quadratic utility; 2 two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; 3 infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; 4 log utility.",

If there is no risk-free rate, then  must be estimated in the cross-sectional regression. Since it is the expected return of a portfolio with zero betas on all factors,  is called the expected zero-beta rate in this circumstance. We often examine factor pricing models using excess returns directly. There is an implicit, though not necessarily justified, division of labor between models of interest rates and models of equity risk premia. Differencing 5.1 between any two returns R ei  R i  R j R j does not have to be risk free, we obtain EReii,aa i,bb , i1,2,...,N. 5.4 Here, ia represents the regression coefficient of the excess return Rei on the factors. This formulation removes the intercept  . It is often the case that the factors are also returns or excess returns. For example, the CAPM uses the return on the market portfolio as the single factor. In this case, the model should apply to the factors as well, and this fact allows us to measure the  coefficients directly rather than via a cross- sectional regression. Each factor has beta of one on itself and zero on all the other factors, of course. Therefore, if the factors are excess returns, we have Ef a  a, and so forth. We can then write the factor model as E R ei   i , a E  f a   i , b E  f b      , i  1, 2, . . . , N . 5.5 The cross-sectional beta pricing model 5.1--5.5 and the time-series regression definition of the betas in 5.2 look very similar. It seems that one can take expectations of the time-series regression 5.2 and arrive at the beta model 5.1, in which case the latter would be vacuous since one can always run a regression of anything on anything. The difference is subtle but crucial: the time-series regressions 5.2 will in general have a different intercept ai for each return i, while the intercept  is the same for all assets in the beta pricing equation 5.1. The beta pricing equation is a restriction on expected returns, and thus imposes a restriction on intercepts in the time-series regression. In the special case that the factors are themselves excess returns, the restriction is particularly simple: the time-series regression intercepts should all be zero. In this case, we can avoid the cross-sectional regression entirely, since there are no free parameters left."

The model is equivalent to a restriction that the intercept is the same for all assets in time-series regressions. When the factors are excess returns, then a  E  f a . If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero,   0. Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form ERii,aa i,bb , i1,2,...,N. 5.1 The  terms are defined as the coefficients in a multiple regression of returns on factors, Ri a  fa  fb i, t 1,2,...,T. 5.2 tii,ati,bt t This is often called a time-series regression, since one runs a regression over time for each security i. The factors f are proxies for marginal utility growth. I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9. For the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f  consumption growth, or f  the return on the market portfolio CAPM. Notice that we run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt about predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in good times or bad times as measured by the factors. The point of the beta model 5.1 is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i  1, 2, . . . , N in 5.1 to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in 5.1 are the explanatory x variables, which vary asset by asset. The  and common for all assetsare the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation 5.1 says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all ERi,i pairs to line up on a straight line with slope  and intercept  . i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and a is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure.

Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM The CAPM, credited to Sharpe 1964 and Lintner 1965a, b, is the first, most famous, and so far most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the wealth portfolio. The function is linear, m abRW . t1 t1 a and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1  EmRW  and 1  E m R f . For example, see equation 8.3. In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, SP500, etc. The CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,  ERi W ERW. i,R This section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutilityRW here,andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor. I present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead. The CAPM is the model m  a  bRw; Rw  wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by 1 two-period quadratic utility; 2 two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; 3 infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; 4 log utility.",
        "1.4. Classic Issues in Finance returns Rmv must be expressible as 19 Rmv Rf a Rm Rf for some number a. 5. Since each point on the mean-variance frontier is perfectly correlated with the discount factor, we must be able to pick constants a , b , d , e such that m  a  bR mv , Rmv dem. Thus, any mean-variance efficient return carries all pricing information. Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa. 6. Given a discount factor, we can also construct a single-beta representa- tion, so expected returns can be described in a single-beta representation using any mean-variance efficient return except the risk-free rate,  ERiRf i,mv ERmvRf . The essence of the beta pricing model is that, even though the means and standard deviations of returns fill out the space inside the mean- variance frontier, a graph of mean returns versus betas should yield a straight line. Since the beta model applies to every return including Rmv itself, and Rmv has a beta of 1 on itself, we can identify the factor risk premiumasERmv Rf. The last two points suggest an intimate relationship between discount factors, beta models, and mean-variance frontiers. I explore this relation in detail in Chapter 6. A problem at the end of this chapter guides you through the algebra to demonstrate points 5 and 6 explicitly. 7.

The priced part is perfectly correlated with the discount factor, and hence perfectly correlated with any frontier return. The residual or idiosyncratic part generates no expected return, so it lies flat as shown in the figure, and it is uncorrelated with the discount factor or any frontier return. Assets inside the frontier or even on the lower portion of the frontier are not worse than assets on the frontier. The frontier and its internal region characterize equilibrium asset returns, with rational investors happy to hold all assets. You would not want to put your whole portfolio in one inefficient asset, but you are happy to put some wealth in such assets.",
        "9 Factor Pricing Models In Chapter 2, I noted that the consumption-based model, while a complete answer to most asset pricing questions in principle, does not yet work well in practice. This observation motivates efforts to tie the discount factor m to other data. Linear factor pricing models are the most popular models of this sort in finance. They dominate discrete-time empirical work. Factor pricing models replace the consumption-based expression for marginal utility growth with a linear model of the form mt1 abft1. a and b are free parameters. As we saw in Chapter 6, this specification is equivalent to a multiple-beta model ERt1    , where  are multiple regression coefficients of returns R on the factors f , and  and  are free parameters. The big question is, what should one use for factors ft1? Factor pricing models look for variables that are good proxies for aggregate marginal utility growth, i.e., variables for which uct1 uct is a sensible and economically interpretable approximation. More directly, the essence of asset pricing is that there are spe- cial states of the world in which investors are especially concerned that their portfolios not do badly. They are willing to trade off some overall performanceaverage returnto make sure that portfolios do not do badly in these particular states of nature. The factors are variables that indicate that these bad states have occurred. 149   a  bft1 9.1",

Discount Factors, Betas, and Mean-Variance Frontiers is a slight subtlety about special cases when there is no risk-free rate, but since it is not important for the basic points I relegate the direct connection and the special cases to Section 6.6. 6.3 Factor Models and Discount Factors We have shown that p  Emx implies a single-beta representation  You can write a linear factor model most compactly as m  bf , letting one of the factors be a constant. However, since we want a connection to the beta representation based on covariances rather than second moments, it is easiest to fold means of the factors in to the constant, and write m  a  b  f with Ef   0 and hence Em  a. The connection is easiest to see in the special case that all the test assets are excess returns. Then 0  EmRe does not identify the mean of m, and we can normalize a arbitrarily. I find it convenient to normalize to E m   1, orm1bf Ef.Then, Beta pricing models are equivalent to linear models for the discount factor m, ERii mabf. using m,x , or R as factors. Let us ask the converse question: suppose we have an expected return-beta model such as CAPM, APT, ICAPM, etc. What discount factor does this model imply? I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work. Theorem: Given the model m1f Efb, 0EmRe, one can find  such that ERe  , where  are the multiple regression coefficients of excess returns Re on the factors.

The payoffs are typically returns or excess returns, including returns scaled by instruments. The prices are typically one returns, zero excess returns, or instruments. To implement GMM, we need to choose a set of moments. The obvious set of moments to use are the pricing errors, g bETxfbp. T This choice is natural but not necessary. You do not have to use p  Emx with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p  Emx. You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p  E mx . It is a choice, and the results will depend on this choice of moments as well as the specification of the model. The GMM estimate is formed from ming bWg b b with first-order condition dWg bdW ETxfbp0, T where This is the second-moment matrix of payoffs and factors.

Given a discount factor, we can also construct a single-beta representa- tion, so expected returns can be described in a single-beta representation using any mean-variance efficient return except the risk-free rate,  ERiRf i,mv ERmvRf . The essence of the beta pricing model is that, even though the means and standard deviations of returns fill out the space inside the mean- variance frontier, a graph of mean returns versus betas should yield a straight line. Since the beta model applies to every return including Rmv itself, and Rmv has a beta of 1 on itself, we can identify the factor risk premiumasERmv Rf. The last two points suggest an intimate relationship between discount factors, beta models, and mean-variance frontiers. I explore this relation in detail in Chapter 6.

        "5 Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations Much empirical work in asset pricing is written in terms of expected return-beta representations and mean-variance frontiers. This chapter introduces expected return-beta representations and mean-variance frontiers. I discuss here the beta representation of factor pricing models. Chapters 6 and 9 discuss where the factor models came from. Chapter 6 shows how an expected return-beta model is equivalent to a linear model for the discount factor, i.e., m  bf . Chapter 9 discusses the derivation of popular factor models such as the CAPM, ICAPM, and APT, i.e., under what assumptions thediscountfactorisalinearfunctionofothervariablesf suchasthemarket return. I summarize the classic Lagrangian approach to the mean-variance frontier. I then introduce a powerful and useful representation of the mean- variance frontier due to Hansen and Richard 1987. This representation uses the state-space geometry familiar from the existence theorems. It is also useful because it is valid in infinite-dimensional payoff spaces, which we shall soon encounter when we add conditioning information, dynamic trading, or options. 77",

You do not have to use p  Emx with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p  Emx. You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p  E mx .

However, since we want a connection to the beta representation based on covariances rather than second moments, it is easiest to fold means of the factors in to the constant, and write m  a  b  f with Ef   0 and hence Em  a. The connection is easiest to see in the special case that all the test assets are excess returns. Then 0  EmRe does not identify the mean of m, and we can normalize a arbitrarily. I find it convenient to normalize to E m   1, orm1bf Ef.Then, Beta pricing models are equivalent to linear models for the discount factor m, ERii mabf. using m,x , or R as factors. Let us ask the converse question: suppose we have an expected return-beta model such as CAPM, APT, ICAPM, etc. What discount factor does this model imply? I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work. Theorem: Given the model m1f Efb, 0EmRe, one can find  such that ERe  , where  are the multiple regression coefficients of excess returns Re on the factors.

        "78 5. Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations 5.1 Expected Return-Beta Representations The expected return-beta expression of a factor pricing model is ERii,aa i,bb . The model is equivalent to a restriction that the intercept is the same for all assets in time-series regressions. When the factors are excess returns, then a  E  f a . If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero,   0. Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form ERii,aa i,bb , i1,2,...,N. 5.1 The  terms are defined as the coefficients in a multiple regression of returns on factors, Ri a  fa  fb i, t 1,2,...,T. 5.2 tii,ati,bt t This is often called a time-series regression, since one runs a regression over time for each security i. The factors f are proxies for marginal utility growth. I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9. For the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f  consumption growth, or f  the return on the market portfolio CAPM. Notice that we run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt about predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in good times or bad times as measured by the factors. The point of the beta model 5.1 is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i  1, 2, . . . , N in 5.1 to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in 5.1 are the explanatory x variables, which vary asset by asset. The  and common for all assetsare the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation 5.1 says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all ERi,i pairs to line up on a straight line with slope  and intercept  . i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and a is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure. Read the beta pricing model to say: for each unit of exposure  to risk factor a, you must provide investors with an expected return premium a. Assets must give investors higher average returns low prices if they pay off well in times",
        "276 14. Maximum Likelihood The factor model, expressed in expected return-beta form, is ERei , i1,2,...,N. ii The betas are defined from time-series regressions Rei a f i. The intercepts ai in the time-series regressions need not be zero, since the model does not apply to the factors. They are not unrestricted, however. Taking expectations of the time-series regression 14.15 and comparing it to 14.14 as we did to derive the restriction   0 for the time-series regression, the restriction   0 implies  a  Ef. 14.16 iit Plugging into 14.15, the time-series regressions must be of the restricted form Rei  f Ef i. 14.17 tiittt In this form, you can see that  determines the mean return.

Three Risk-Free Rate Analogues 111  Section 5.4 showed how we can span the mean-variance frontier with R and a risk-free rate, if there is one, or the zero-beta, minimum-variance, or constant-mimicking portfolio return R  proj1X p proj1X  if there is no risk-free rate. The latter is particularly nice in the case of a linear factor model, since we may consider the constant as a factor, so the frontier is entirely generated by factor-mimicking portfolio returns. 6.5 Three Risk-Free Rate Analogues I introduce three counterparts to the risk-free rate that show up in asset pricing formulas when there is no risk-free rate. The three returns are the zero-beta return, the minimum-variance return, and the constant-mimicking portfolio return. Three different generalizations of the risk-free rate are useful when a risk-free rate or unit payoff is not in the set of payoffs. These are the zero-beta return, the minimum-variance return, and the constant-mimicking portfolio return. I introduce the returns in this section, and I use them in the next section to state some special cases involving the mean-variance frontier. Each of these returns maintains one property of the risk-free rate in a market in which there is no risk-free rate. The zero-beta return is a mean-variance effi- cient return that is uncorrelated with another given mean-variance efficient return. The minimum-variance return is just that. The constant-mimicking portfolio return is the return on the payoff closest to the unit payoff. Each of these returns has a representation in the standard form R   wR e  with slightly different w. In addition, the expected returns of these risky assets are used in some asset pricing representations. For example, the zero-beta rate is often used to refer to the expected value of the zero-beta return. Each of these risk-free rate analogues is mean-variance efficient. Thus, I characterize each one by finding its weight w in a representation of the form R  wRe. We derived such a representation above for the risk-free rate as equation 5.20, Rf RRfRe. 6.15 In the last subsection, I show how each risk-free rate analogue reduces to the risk-free rate when there is one.",

Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM The CAPM, credited to Sharpe 1964 and Lintner 1965a, b, is the first, most famous, and so far most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the wealth portfolio. The function is linear, m abRW . t1 t1 a and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1  EmRW  and 1  E m R f . For example, see equation 8.3. In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, SP500, etc. The CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,  ERi W ERW. i,R This section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutilityRW here,andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor. I present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead. The CAPM is the model m  a  bRw; Rw  wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by 1 two-period quadratic utility; 2 two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; 3 infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; 4 log utility.",

I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work.

The equivalence theorems are obviously important to the theme of this book. They show that the choice of discount factor language versus expected return-beta language or mean-variance frontier is entirely one of convenience. Nothing in the more traditional statements is lost. p  Emx is Innocuous Before Roll 1977, expected return-beta representations had been derived in the context of special and explicit economic models, especially the CAPM. In empirical work, the success of any expected return-beta model seemed like a vindication of the whole structure. The fact that, for example, one might use the NYSE value-weighted index portfolio in place of the return on total wealth predicted by the CAPM seemed like a minor issue of empirical implementation. 121",

If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero,   0. Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form ERii,aa i,bb , i1,2,...,N. 5.1 The  terms are defined as the coefficients in a multiple regression of returns on factors, Ri a  fa  fb i, t 1,2,...,T. 5.2 tii,ati,bt t This is often called a time-series regression, since one runs a regression over time for each security i. The factors f are proxies for marginal utility growth. I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9. For the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f  consumption growth, or f  the return on the market portfolio CAPM. Notice that we run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt about predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in good times or bad times as measured by the factors. The point of the beta model 5.1 is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i  1, 2, . . . , N in 5.1 to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in 5.1 are the explanatory x variables, which vary asset by asset. The  and common for all assetsare the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation 5.1 says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all ERi,i pairs to line up on a straight line with slope  and intercept  . i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and a is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure.

Chapters 6 and 9 discuss where the factor models came from. Chapter 6 shows how an expected return-beta model is equivalent to a linear model for the discount factor, i.e., m  bf .

I summarize the classic Lagrangian approach to the mean-variance frontier. I then introduce a powerful and useful representation of the mean- variance frontier due to Hansen and Richard 1987.

It is also useful because it is valid in infinite-dimensional payoff spaces, which we shall soon encounter when we add conditioning information, dynamic trading, or options. 77",

        "20.2. The Cross Section: CAPM and Multifactor Models 445 I have focused on the size and value factors since they provide the most empirically successful multifactor model to date, and have therefore attracted much attention. Several authors have used macroeconomic variables as factors in order to examine directly the story that stock performance during bad macroeco- nomic times determines average returns. Jagannathan and Wang 1996 and Reyfman 1997 use labor income; Chen, Roll, and Ross 1986 use indus- trial production and inflation among other variables. Cochrane 1996 uses investment growth. All these authors find that average returns line up against betas calculated using these macroeconomic indicators. The factors are the- oretically easier to motivate, but none explains the value and size portfolios as well as the theoretically less solid, so far size and value factors. Lettau and Ludvigson 2001a specify a macroeconomic model that does just as well as the FamaFrench factors in explaining the 25 Fama French portfolios. Their plots of actual average returns versus model pre- dictions show a relation as strong as those of Figures 20.12 and 20.13. Their model is mt1 abcayct1, t where cay is a measure of the consumption-wealth ratio. This is a scaled factor model of the sort advocated in Chapter 8. You can think of it as capturing a time-varying risk aversion. Though Mertons 1971, 1973a theory says that variables which predict market returns should show up as factors which explain cross-sectional vari- ation in average returns, surprisingly few papers have actually tried to see whether this is true, now that we do have variables that we think forecast the market return. Campbell 1996 and Ferson and Harvey 1999 are among the few exceptions. Momentum and Reversal Since a string of good returns gives a high price, it is not surprising that stocks that do well for a long time and hence build up a high price subsequently do poorly, and stocks that do poorly for a long time and Sorting stocks based on past performance, you find that a portfolio that buys long-term losers and sells long-term winners does better than the oppositeindividual stock long-term returns mean-revert. This reversal effect makes sense given return predictability and mean-reversion, and is explained by the FamaFrench three-factor model. However, a port- folio that buys short-term winners and sells short-term losers also does wellmomentum. This effect is a puzzle.",
        "12 Regression-Based Tests of Linear Factor Models The next four chapters study the question, how should we estimate and evaluate linear factor models: models of the form p  Emx, m  bf or equivalently ERe  ? These models are by far the most common in empirical asset pricing, and there is a large literature on econometric tech- niques to estimate and evaluate them. Each technique focuses on the same questions: how to estimate parameters, how to calculate standard errors of the estimated parameters, how to calculate standard errors of the pricing errors, and how to test the model, usually with a test statistic of the form   V  1  . I start in this chapter with simple and long-standing time-series and cross-sectional regression tests. In Chapter 13, I pursue the GMM approach to the model expressed in p  Emx, m  bf form. Chapter 14 summa- rizes the principle of maximum likelihood estimation and derives maximum likelihood estimates and tests. Finally, Chapter 15 compares the different approaches. As always, the theme is the underlying unity. All of the techniques come down to one of two basic ideas: time-series regression or cross-sectional regression. Time-series regression turns out to be a limiting case of cross- sectional regression. The GMM, p  E mx  approach turns out to be almost identical to cross-sectional regressions. Maximum likelihood with appro- priate statistical assumptions justifies the time-series and cross-sectional regression approaches. The formulas for parameter estimates, standard errors, and test statistics are all strikingly similar. 229",

The model is equivalent to a restriction that the intercept is the same for all assets in time-series regressions. When the factors are excess returns, then a  E  f a . If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero,   0. Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form ERii,aa i,bb , i1,2,...,N. 5.1 The  terms are defined as the coefficients in a multiple regression of returns on factors, Ri a  fa  fb i, t 1,2,...,T. 5.2 tii,ati,bt t This is often called a time-series regression, since one runs a regression over time for each security i. The factors f are proxies for marginal utility growth. I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9. For the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f  consumption growth, or f  the return on the market portfolio CAPM. Notice that we run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt about predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in good times or bad times as measured by the factors. The point of the beta model 5.1 is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i  1, 2, . . . , N in 5.1 to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in 5.1 are the explanatory x variables, which vary asset by asset. The  and common for all assetsare the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation 5.1 says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all ERi,i pairs to line up on a straight line with slope  and intercept  . i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and a is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure.

The payoffs are typically returns or excess returns, including returns scaled by instruments. The prices are typically one returns, zero excess returns, or instruments. To implement GMM, we need to choose a set of moments. The obvious set of moments to use are the pricing errors, g bETxfbp. T This choice is natural but not necessary. You do not have to use p  Emx with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p  Emx. You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p  E mx . It is a choice, and the results will depend on this choice of moments as well as the specification of the model. The GMM estimate is formed from ming bWg b b with first-order condition dWg bdW ETxfbp0, T where This is the second-moment matrix of payoffs and factors.

What could be more sensible? The model 13.1 says that average prices should be a linear function of the second moment of payoff with factors, so the estimate runs a linear regression. These are cross-sectional regressions since they operate across assets on sample averages.

        "152 9. Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM The CAPM, credited to Sharpe 1964 and Lintner 1965a, b, is the first, most famous, and so far most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the wealth portfolio. The function is linear, m abRW . t1 t1 a and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1  EmRW  and 1  E m R f . For example, see equation 8.3. In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, SP500, etc. The CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,  ERi W ERW. i,R This section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutilityRW here,andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor. I present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead. The CAPM is the model m  a  bRw; Rw  wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by 1 two-period quadratic utility; 2 two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; 3 infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; 4 log utility.",

        "438 20. Expected Returns in the Time Series and Cross Section long-term and corporate bonds have mean returns in line with their low betas, despite their standard deviations nearly as high as those of stocks. Comparing this graph with the similar Figure 2.4 of the consumption-based model, the CAPM fits very well. In fact, Figure 20.8 captures one of the first significant failures of the CAPM. The smallest firms the far right portfolio seem to earn an average return a few percent too high given their betas. This is the celebrated small- firm effect Banz 1981. Would that all failed economic theories worked so well! It is also atypical in that the estimated market line through the stock portfolios is steeper than predicted, while measurement error in betas usually means that the estimated market line is too flat. FamaFrench 3 Factors In retrospect, it is surprising that the CAPM worked so well for so long. The assumptions on which it is built are very stylized and simplified. Asset pricing theory recognized at least since Merton 1971, 1973a the theoretical possibility, indeed probability, that we should need factors, state variables, or sources of priced risk beyond movements in the market portfolio in order to explain why some average returns are higher than others. The FamaFrench model is one of the most popular multifactor models that now dominate empirical research. Fama and French 1993 presents the model; Fama and French 1996 gives an excellent summary, and also shows how the three-factor model performs in evaluating expected return puzzles beyond the size and value effects that motivated it. Value stocks have market values that are small relative to the accoun- tants book value. Book values essentially track past investment expen- ditures. Book value is a better divisor for individual-firm price than are dividends or earnings, which can be negative. This category of stocks has given large average returns. Growth stocks are the opposite of value and have had low average returns. Since low prices relative to dividends, earnings, or book value forecast times when the market return will be high, it is natural to suppose that these same signals forecast categories of stocks that will do well; the value effect is the cross-sectional analogy to price-ratio predictability in the time series. Book market sorted portfolios show a large variation in average returns that is unrelated to market betas. The Fama and French three-factor model successfully explains the average returns of the 25 size and book market sorted portfolios with a three-factor model, consisting of the market, a small minus big SMB portfolio, and a high minus low HML portfolio."

        "1.4. Classic Issues in Finance returns Rmv must be expressible as 19 Rmv Rf a Rm Rf for some number a. 5. Since each point on the mean-variance frontier is perfectly correlated with the discount factor, we must be able to pick constants a , b , d , e such that m  a  bR mv , Rmv dem. Thus, any mean-variance efficient return carries all pricing information. Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa. 6. Given a discount factor, we can also construct a single-beta representa- tion, so expected returns can be described in a single-beta representation using any mean-variance efficient return except the risk-free rate,  ERiRf i,mv ERmvRf . The essence of the beta pricing model is that, even though the means and standard deviations of returns fill out the space inside the mean- variance frontier, a graph of mean returns versus betas should yield a straight line. Since the beta model applies to every return including Rmv itself, and Rmv has a beta of 1 on itself, we can identify the factor risk premiumasERmv Rf. The last two points suggest an intimate relationship between discount factors, beta models, and mean-variance frontiers. I explore this relation in detail in Chapter 6. A problem at the end of this chapter guides you through the algebra to demonstrate points 5 and 6 explicitly. 7.

The priced part is perfectly correlated with the discount factor, and hence perfectly correlated with any frontier return. The residual or idiosyncratic part generates no expected return, so it lies flat as shown in the figure, and it is uncorrelated with the discount factor or any frontier return. Assets inside the frontier or even on the lower portion of the frontier are not worse than assets on the frontier. The frontier and its internal region characterize equilibrium asset returns, with rational investors happy to hold all assets.

        "106 6. Discount Factors, Betas, and Mean-Variance Frontiers is a slight subtlety about special cases when there is no risk-free rate, but since it is not important for the basic points I relegate the direct connection and the special cases to Section 6.6. 6.3 Factor Models and Discount Factors We have shown that p  Emx implies a single-beta representation  You can write a linear factor model most compactly as m  bf , letting one of the factors be a constant. However, since we want a connection to the beta representation based on covariances rather than second moments, it is easiest to fold means of the factors in to the constant, and write m  a  b  f with Ef   0 and hence Em  a. The connection is easiest to see in the special case that all the test assets are excess returns. Then 0  EmRe does not identify the mean of m, and we can normalize a arbitrarily. I find it convenient to normalize to E m   1, orm1bf Ef.Then, Beta pricing models are equivalent to linear models for the discount factor m, ERii mabf. using m,x , or R as factors. Let us ask the converse question: suppose we have an expected return-beta model such as CAPM, APT, ICAPM, etc. What discount factor does this model imply? I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work.

        "80 5. Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations We can impose this condition rather than estimate  in the cross-sectional regression 5.3. If there is no risk-free rate, then  must be estimated in the cross-sectional regression. Since it is the expected return of a portfolio with zero betas on all factors,  is called the expected zero-beta rate in this circumstance. We often examine factor pricing models using excess returns directly. There is an implicit, though not necessarily justified, division of labor between models of interest rates and models of equity risk premia. Differencing 5.1 between any two returns R ei  R i  R j R j does not have to be risk free, we obtain EReii,aa i,bb , i1,2,...,N. 5.4 Here, ia represents the regression coefficient of the excess return Rei on the factors. This formulation removes the intercept  . It is often the case that the factors are also returns or excess returns. For example, the CAPM uses the return on the market portfolio as the single factor. In this case, the model should apply to the factors as well, and this fact allows us to measure the  coefficients directly rather than via a cross- sectional regression. Each factor has beta of one on itself and zero on all the other factors, of course. Therefore, if the factors are excess returns, we have Ef a  a, and so forth. We can then write the factor model as E R ei   i , a E  f a   i , b E  f b      , i  1, 2, . . . , N . 5.5 The cross-sectional beta pricing model 5.1--5.5 and the time-series regression definition of the betas in 5.2 look very similar. It seems that one can take expectations of the time-series regression 5.2 and arrive at the beta model 5.1, in which case the latter would be vacuous since one can always run a regression of anything on anything. The difference is subtle but crucial: the time-series regressions 5.2 will in general have a different intercept ai for each return i, while the intercept  is the same for all assets in the beta pricing equation 5.1. The beta pricing equation is a restriction on expected returns, and thus imposes a restriction on intercepts in the time-series regression. In the special case that the factors are themselves excess returns, the restriction is particularly simple: the time-series regression intercepts should all be zero. In this case, we can avoid the cross-sectional regression entirely, since there are no free parameters left.",

Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa. 6.

The essence of the beta pricing model is that, even though the means and standard deviations of returns fill out the space inside the mean- variance frontier, a graph of mean returns versus betas should yield a straight line. Since the beta model applies to every return including Rmv itself, and Rmv has a beta of 1 on itself, we can identify the factor risk premiumasERmv Rf.

        "78 5. Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations 5.1 Expected Return-Beta Representations The expected return-beta expression of a factor pricing model is ERii,aa i,bb . The model is equivalent to a restriction that the intercept is the same for all assets in time-series regressions. When the factors are excess returns, then a  E  f a . If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero,   0. Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form ERii,aa i,bb , i1,2,...,N. 5.1 The  terms are defined as the coefficients in a multiple regression of returns on factors, Ri a  fa  fb i, t 1,2,...,T. 5.2 tii,ati,bt t This is often called a time-series regression, since one runs a regression over time for each security i. The factors f are proxies for marginal utility growth. I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9. For the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f  consumption growth, or f  the return on the market portfolio CAPM. Notice that we run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt about predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in good times or bad times as measured by the factors. The point of the beta model 5.1 is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i  1, 2, . . . , N in 5.1 to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in 5.1 are the explanatory x variables, which vary asset by asset. The  and common for all assetsare the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation 5.1 says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all ERi,i pairs to line up on a straight line with slope  and intercept  . i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and a is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure.

I summarize the classic Lagrangian approach to the mean-variance frontier. I then introduce a powerful and useful representation of the mean- variance frontier due to Hansen and Richard 1987.

It is also useful because it is valid in infinite-dimensional payoff spaces, which we shall soon encounter when we add conditioning information, dynamic trading, or options. 77",

        "9 Factor Pricing Models In Chapter 2, I noted that the consumption-based model, while a complete answer to most asset pricing questions in principle, does not yet work well in practice. This observation motivates efforts to tie the discount factor m to other data. Linear factor pricing models are the most popular models of this sort in finance. They dominate discrete-time empirical work. Factor pricing models replace the consumption-based expression for marginal utility growth with a linear model of the form mt1 abft1. a and b are free parameters. As we saw in Chapter 6, this specification is equivalent to a multiple-beta model ERt1    , where  are multiple regression coefficients of returns R on the factors f , and  and  are free parameters. The big question is, what should one use for factors ft1? Factor pricing models look for variables that are good proxies for aggregate marginal utility growth, i.e., variables for which uct1 uct is a sensible and economically interpretable approximation. More directly, the essence of asset pricing is that there are spe- cial states of the world in which investors are especially concerned that their portfolios not do badly. They are willing to trade off some overall performanceaverage returnto make sure that portfolios do not do badly in these particular states of nature. The factors are variables that indicate that these bad states have occurred. 149   a  bft1 9.1",
        "80 5. Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations We can impose this condition rather than estimate  in the cross-sectional regression 5.3. If there is no risk-free rate, then  must be estimated in the cross-sectional regression. Since it is the expected return of a portfolio with zero betas on all factors,  is called the expected zero-beta rate in this circumstance. We often examine factor pricing models using excess returns directly. There is an implicit, though not necessarily justified, division of labor between models of interest rates and models of equity risk premia. Differencing 5.1 between any two returns R ei  R i  R j R j does not have to be risk free, we obtain EReii,aa i,bb , i1,2,...,N. 5.4 Here, ia represents the regression coefficient of the excess return Rei on the factors. This formulation removes the intercept  . It is often the case that the factors are also returns or excess returns. For example, the CAPM uses the return on the market portfolio as the single factor. In this case, the model should apply to the factors as well, and this fact allows us to measure the  coefficients directly rather than via a cross- sectional regression. Each factor has beta of one on itself and zero on all the other factors, of course. Therefore, if the factors are excess returns, we have Ef a  a, and so forth. We can then write the factor model as E R ei   i , a E  f a   i , b E  f b      , i  1, 2, . . . , N . 5.5 The cross-sectional beta pricing model 5.1--5.5 and the time-series regression definition of the betas in 5.2 look very similar. It seems that one can take expectations of the time-series regression 5.2 and arrive at the beta model 5.1, in which case the latter would be vacuous since one can always run a regression of anything on anything. The difference is subtle but crucial: the time-series regressions 5.2 will in general have a different intercept ai for each return i, while the intercept  is the same for all assets in the beta pricing equation 5.1. The beta pricing equation is a restriction on expected returns, and thus imposes a restriction on intercepts in the time-series regression. In the special case that the factors are themselves excess returns, the restriction is particularly simple: the time-series regression intercepts should all be zero. In this case, we can avoid the cross-sectional regression entirely, since there are no free parameters left."

Let us ask the converse question: suppose we have an expected return-beta model such as CAPM, APT, ICAPM, etc. What discount factor does this model imply? I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result.

        "152 9. Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM The CAPM, credited to Sharpe 1964 and Lintner 1965a, b, is the first, most famous, and so far most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the wealth portfolio. The function is linear, m abRW . t1 t1 a and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1  EmRW  and 1  E m R f . For example, see equation 8.3. In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, SP500, etc. The CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,  ERi W ERW. i,R This section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutilityRW here,andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor. I present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead. The CAPM is the model m  a  bRw; Rw  wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by 1 two-period quadratic utility; 2 two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; 3 infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; 4 log utility.",

You do not have to use p  Emx with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p  Emx. You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p  E mx .

The model is equivalent to a restriction that the intercept is the same for all assets in time-series regressions. When the factors are excess returns, then a  E  f a . If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero,   0. Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form ERii,aa i,bb , i1,2,...,N. 5.1 The  terms are defined as the coefficients in a multiple regression of returns on factors, Ri a  fa  fb i, t 1,2,...,T. 5.2 tii,ati,bt t This is often called a time-series regression, since one runs a regression over time for each security i. The factors f are proxies for marginal utility growth. I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9. For the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f  consumption growth, or f  the return on the market portfolio CAPM. Notice that we run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt about predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in good times or bad times as measured by the factors. The point of the beta model 5.1 is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i  1, 2, . . . , N in 5.1 to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in 5.1 are the explanatory x variables, which vary asset by asset. The  and common for all assetsare the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation 5.1 says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all ERi,i pairs to line up on a straight line with slope  and intercept  . i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and a is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure.

Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM The CAPM, credited to Sharpe 1964 and Lintner 1965a, b, is the first, most famous, and so far most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the wealth portfolio. The function is linear, m abRW . t1 t1 a and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1  EmRW  and 1  E m R f . For example, see equation 8.3. In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, SP500, etc. The CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,  ERi W ERW. i,R This section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutilityRW here,andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor. I present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead. The CAPM is the model m  a  bRw; Rw  wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by 1 two-period quadratic utility; 2 two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; 3 infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; 4 log utility.",
        "78 5. Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations 5.1 Expected Return-Beta Representations The expected return-beta expression of a factor pricing model is ERii,aa i,bb . The model is equivalent to a restriction that the intercept is the same for all assets in time-series regressions. When the factors are excess returns, then a  E  f a . If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero,   0. Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form ERii,aa i,bb , i1,2,...,N. 5.1 The  terms are defined as the coefficients in a multiple regression of returns on factors, Ri a  fa  fb i, t 1,2,...,T. 5.2 tii,ati,bt t This is often called a time-series regression, since one runs a regression over time for each security i. The factors f are proxies for marginal utility growth. I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9. For the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f  consumption growth, or f  the return on the market portfolio CAPM. Notice that we run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt about predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in good times or bad times as measured by the factors. The point of the beta model 5.1 is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i  1, 2, . . . , N in 5.1 to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in 5.1 are the explanatory x variables, which vary asset by asset. The  and common for all assetsare the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation 5.1 says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all ERi,i pairs to line up on a straight line with slope  and intercept  . i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and a is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure. Read the beta pricing model to say: for each unit of exposure  to risk factor a, you must provide investors with an expected return premium a. Assets must give investors higher average returns low prices if they pay off well in times",

If you express the mean-variance frontier as a linear combination of factor-mimicking portfolios from a factor model, do the relative weights of the various factor portfolios in the mean-variance efficient return change as you sweep out the frontier, or do they stay the same? Start with the risk-free rate case. 5. For an arbitrary mean-variance efficient return of the form R  wRe, find its zero-beta return and zero-beta rate. Show that your rate reduces to the risk-free rate when there is one. 6. When the economy is risk neutral, and if there is no risk-free rate, show that the zero-beta, minimum-variance, and constant-mimicking portfolio returns are again all equivalent, though not equal to the risk-free rate.

However, since the objective is locally quadratic, the search is usually straightforward. Second-Stage Estimates: Why S1? What weighting matrix should you use? The weighting matrix directs GMM to emphasize some moments or linear combinations of moments at the expense of others. You might start with W  I , i.e., try to price all assets equally well. A W that is not the identity matrix can be used to offset dif- ferences in units between the moments. You might also start with different elementsonthediagonalofW ifyouthinksomeassetsaremoreinteresting, more informative, or better measured than others. The second-stage estimate picks a weighting matrix based on statisti- cal considerations. Some asset returns may have much more variance than others. For those assets, the sample mean g  ET mt Rt  1 will be a much T less accurate measurement of the population mean E mR 1, since the sam- ple mean will vary more from sample to sample. Hence, it seems like a good idea to pay less attention to pricing errors from assets with high variance of mt Rt  1. One could implement this idea by using a W matrix composed of inverse variances of ET mt Rt 1 on the diagonal. More generally, since asset returns are correlated, one might think of using the covariance matrix of ET mt Rt 1. This weighting matrix pays most attention to linear combinations of moments about which the data set at hand has the most information.

Since each point on the mean-variance frontier is perfectly correlated with the discount factor, we must be able to pick constants a , b , d , e such that m  a  bR mv , Rmv dem. Thus, any mean-variance efficient return carries all pricing information. Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa. 6. Given a discount factor, we can also construct a single-beta representa- tion, so expected returns can be described in a single-beta representation using any mean-variance efficient return except the risk-free rate,  ERiRf i,mv ERmvRf . The essence of the beta pricing model is that, even though the means and standard deviations of returns fill out the space inside the mean- variance frontier, a graph of mean returns versus betas should yield a straight line. Since the beta model applies to every return including Rmv itself, and Rmv has a beta of 1 on itself, we can identify the factor risk premiumasERmv Rf. The last two points suggest an intimate relationship between discount factors, beta models, and mean-variance frontiers. I explore this relation in detail in Chapter 6.

The priced part is perfectly correlated with the discount factor, and hence perfectly correlated with any frontier return. The residual or idiosyncratic part generates no expected return, so it lies flat as shown in the figure, and it is uncorrelated with the discount factor or any frontier return. Assets inside the frontier or even on the lower portion of the frontier are not worse than assets on the frontier. The frontier and its internal region characterize equilibrium asset returns, with rational investors happy to hold all assets. You would not want to put your whole portfolio in one inefficient asset, but you are happy to put some wealth in such assets.",

Discount Factors, Betas, and Mean-Variance Frontiers is a slight subtlety about special cases when there is no risk-free rate, but since it is not important for the basic points I relegate the direct connection and the special cases to Section 6.6. 6.3 Factor Models and Discount Factors We have shown that p  Emx implies a single-beta representation  You can write a linear factor model most compactly as m  bf , letting one of the factors be a constant. However, since we want a connection to the beta representation based on covariances rather than second moments, it is easiest to fold means of the factors in to the constant, and write m  a  b  f with Ef   0 and hence Em  a. The connection is easiest to see in the special case that all the test assets are excess returns. Then 0  EmRe does not identify the mean of m, and we can normalize a arbitrarily. I find it convenient to normalize to E m   1, orm1bf Ef.Then, Beta pricing models are equivalent to linear models for the discount factor m, ERii mabf. using m,x , or R as factors. Let us ask the converse question: suppose we have an expected return-beta model such as CAPM, APT, ICAPM, etc. What discount factor does this model imply? I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work.

The payoffs are typically returns or excess returns, including returns scaled by instruments. The prices are typically one returns, zero excess returns, or instruments. To implement GMM, we need to choose a set of moments. The obvious set of moments to use are the pricing errors, g bETxfbp. T This choice is natural but not necessary. You do not have to use p  Emx with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p  Emx. You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p  E mx .

Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa. 6. Given a discount factor, we can also construct a single-beta representa- tion, so expected returns can be described in a single-beta representation using any mean-variance efficient return except the risk-free rate,  ERiRf i,mv ERmvRf . The essence of the beta pricing model is that, even though the means and standard deviations of returns fill out the space inside the mean- variance frontier, a graph of mean returns versus betas should yield a straight line. Since the beta model applies to every return including Rmv itself, and Rmv has a beta of 1 on itself, we can identify the factor risk premiumasERmv Rf. The last two points suggest an intimate relationship between discount factors, beta models, and mean-variance frontiers. I explore this relation in detail in Chapter 6.

Let us ask the converse question: suppose we have an expected return-beta model such as CAPM, APT, ICAPM, etc. What discount factor does this model imply? I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work.

If a risk-free rate is traded, we can simply observe that it is not infinite and verify the fact. Also, in a complete market, Em cannot be zero since, by absence of arbitrage, m  0. We will see similar special cases in the remaining theorems: the manipulations only work for discount factor choices that do not imply zero or infinite risk-free rates.

        "80 5. Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations We can impose this condition rather than estimate  in the cross-sectional regression 5.3. If there is no risk-free rate, then  must be estimated in the cross-sectional regression. Since it is the expected return of a portfolio with zero betas on all factors,  is called the expected zero-beta rate in this circumstance. We often examine factor pricing models using excess returns directly. There is an implicit, though not necessarily justified, division of labor between models of interest rates and models of equity risk premia. Differencing 5.1 between any two returns R ei  R i  R j R j does not have to be risk free, we obtain EReii,aa i,bb , i1,2,...,N. 5.4 Here, ia represents the regression coefficient of the excess return Rei on the factors. This formulation removes the intercept  . It is often the case that the factors are also returns or excess returns. For example, the CAPM uses the return on the market portfolio as the single factor. In this case, the model should apply to the factors as well, and this fact allows us to measure the  coefficients directly rather than via a cross- sectional regression. Each factor has beta of one on itself and zero on all the other factors, of course. Therefore, if the factors are excess returns, we have Ef a  a, and so forth. We can then write the factor model as E R ei   i , a E  f a   i , b E  f b      , i  1, 2, . . . , N . 5.5 The cross-sectional beta pricing model 5.1--5.5 and the time-series regression definition of the betas in 5.2 look very similar. It seems that one can take expectations of the time-series regression 5.2 and arrive at the beta model 5.1, in which case the latter would be vacuous since one can always run a regression of anything on anything. The difference is subtle but crucial: the time-series regressions 5.2 will in general have a different intercept ai for each return i, while the intercept  is the same for all assets in the beta pricing equation 5.1. The beta pricing equation is a restriction on expected returns, and thus imposes a restriction on intercepts in the time-series regression. In the special case that the factors are themselves excess returns, the restriction is particularly simple: the time-series regression intercepts should all be zero. In this case, we can avoid the cross-sectional regression entirely, since there are no free parameters left.",

The model is equivalent to a restriction that the intercept is the same for all assets in time-series regressions. When the factors are excess returns, then a  E  f a . If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero,   0.

This regression is not tt about predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in good times or bad times as measured by the factors. The point of the beta model 5.1 is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i  1, 2, . . . , N in 5.1 to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in 5.1 are the explanatory x variables, which vary asset by asset. The  and common for all assetsare the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation 5.1 says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all ERi,i pairs to line up on a straight line with slope  and intercept  . i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and a is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure.

Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model CAPM The CAPM, credited to Sharpe 1964 and Lintner 1965a, b, is the first, most famous, and so far most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the wealth portfolio. The function is linear, m abRW . t1 t1 a and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1  EmRW  and 1  E m R f . For example, see equation 8.3. In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, SP500, etc. The CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,  ERi W ERW. i,R This section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutilityRW here,andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor. I present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead. The CAPM is the model m  a  bRw; Rw  wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by 1 two-period quadratic utility; 2 two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; 3 infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; 4 log utility.",

The payoffs are typically returns or excess returns, including returns scaled by instruments. The prices are typically one returns, zero excess returns, or instruments. To implement GMM, we need to choose a set of moments. The obvious set of moments to use are the pricing errors, g bETxfbp. T This choice is natural but not necessary. You do not have to use p  Emx with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p  Emx. You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p  E mx . It is a choice, and the results will depend on this choice of moments as well as the specification of the model. The GMM estimate is formed from ming bWg b b with first-order condition dWg bdW ETxfbp0, T where This is the second-moment matrix of payoffs and factors.

This observation motivates efforts to tie the discount factor m to other data. Linear factor pricing models are the most popular models of this sort in finance. They dominate discrete-time empirical work. Factor pricing models replace the consumption-based expression for marginal utility growth with a linear model of the form mt1 abft1. a and b are free parameters. As we saw in Chapter 6, this specification is equivalent to a multiple-beta model ERt1    , where  are multiple regression coefficients of returns R on the factors f , and  and  are free parameters. The big question is, what should one use for factors ft1? Factor pricing models look for variables that are good proxies for aggregate marginal utility growth, i.e., variables for which uct1 uct is a sensible and economically interpretable approximation. More directly, the essence of asset pricing is that there are spe- cial states of the world in which investors are especially concerned that their portfolios not do badly.

GMM for Linear Factor Models in Discount Factor Form 13.2 The Case of Excess Returns When mt1  a  bft1 and the test assets are excess returns, the GMM estimate is a GLS cross-sectional regression of average returns on the second moments of returns with factors, First stage : b  dd1dE Re , 1T Second stage : b  dS1d1dS1E Re , 2T where d is the covariance matrix between returns and factors. The other formulas are the same. The analysis of the last section requires that at least one asset has a nonzeroprice.Ifallassetsareexcessreturns,thenb dd1dE p0. 1T Linear factor models are most often applied to excess returns, so this case is important. The trouble is that in this case the mean discount factor is not identified. If EmRe   0, then E2  mRe   0. Analogously in expected return-beta models, if all test assets are excess returns, then we have no information on the level of the zero-beta rate. Writing out the model as m  a  bf , we cannot separately identify a and b so we have to choose some normalization. The choice is entirely one of convenience; lack of identification means precisely that the pricing errors do not depend on the choice of normalization. The easiest choice is a  1.

        "5 Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations Much empirical work in asset pricing is written in terms of expected return-beta representations and mean-variance frontiers. This chapter introduces expected return-beta representations and mean-variance frontiers. I discuss here the beta representation of factor pricing models. Chapters 6 and 9 discuss where the factor models came from. Chapter 6 shows how an expected return-beta model is equivalent to a linear model for the discount factor, i.e., m  bf . Chapter 9 discusses the derivation of popular factor models such as the CAPM, ICAPM, and APT, i.e., under what assumptions thediscountfactorisalinearfunctionofothervariablesf suchasthemarket return. I summarize the classic Lagrangian approach to the mean-variance frontier. I then introduce a powerful and useful representation of the mean- variance frontier due to Hansen and Richard 1987. This representation uses the state-space geometry familiar from the existence theorems. It is also useful because it is valid in infinite-dimensional payoff spaces, which we shall soon encounter when we add conditioning information, dynamic trading, or options. 77"
