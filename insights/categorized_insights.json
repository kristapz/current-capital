Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe CAPM, credited to Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965a, b), is the first, most famous, and (so far) most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the \u2018\u2018wealth portfolio.\u2019\u2019 The function is linear,\nm =a+bRW . t+1 t+1\na and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1 = E(mRW ) and 1 = E (m )R f . [For example, see equation (8.3).] In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, S&P500, etc.\nThe CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,\n\u0001\u0002\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2 W E(RW)\u2212\u03b3. i,R\nThis section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutility(RW here),andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor.\nI present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by (1) two-period quadratic utility; (2) two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; (3) infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; (4) log utility.",

However, since we want a connection to the beta representation based on covariances rather than second moments, it is easiest to fold means of the factors in to the constant, and write m = a + b \u2032 f with E(f ) = 0 and hence E(m) = a.\nThe connection is easiest to see in the special case that all the test assets are excess returns. Then 0 = E(mRe) does not identify the mean of m, and we can normalize a arbitrarily. I find it convenient to normalize to E (m ) = 1, orm=1+b\u2032[f \u2212E(f)].Then,\n    Beta pricing models are equivalent to linear models for the discount factor m,\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03bb\u2032\u03b2i \u21d4m=a+b\u2032f.\n   using m,x , or R as factors. Let us ask the converse question: suppose we have an expected return-beta model such as CAPM, APT, ICAPM, etc. What discount factor does this model imply? I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work.\nTheorem: Given the model\nm=1+[f \u2212E(f)]\u2032b, 0=E(mRe),\none can find \u03bb such that\nE(Re) = \u03b2\u2032\u03bb,\nwhere \u03b2 are the multiple regression coefficients of excess returns Re on the factors.

The payoffs are typically returns or excess returns, including returns scaled by instruments. The prices are typically one (returns), zero (excess returns), or instruments.\nTo implement GMM, we need to choose a set of moments. The obvious set of moments to use are the pricing errors,\ng (b)=ET(xf\u2032b\u2212p). T\nThis choice is natural but not necessary. You do not have to use p = E(mx) with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p = E(mx). You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p = E (mx ). It is a choice, and the results will depend on this choice of moments as well as the specification of the model.\nThe GMM estimate is formed from\nming (b)\u2032Wg (b)\nb\nwith first-order condition\nd\u2032Wg (b)=d\u2032W ET(xf\u2032b\u2212p)=0,\nT\nwhere\nThis is the second-moment matrix of payoffs and factors.

What could be more sensible? The model (13.1) says that average prices should be a linear function of the second moment of payoff with factors, so the estimate runs a linear regression.

Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe CAPM, credited to Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965a, b), is the first, most famous, and (so far) most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the \u2018\u2018wealth portfolio.\u2019\u2019 The function is linear,\nm =a+bRW . t+1 t+1\na and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1 = E(mRW ) and 1 = E (m )R f . [For example, see equation (8.3).] In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, S&P500, etc.\nThe CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,\n\u0001\u0002\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2 W E(RW)\u2212\u03b3. i,R\nThis section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutility(RW here),andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor.\nI present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by (1) two-period quadratic utility; (2) two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; (3) infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; (4) log utility.",

If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero, \u03b1 = 0.\n     Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, i=1,2,...,N.

I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9.\nFor the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f = consumption\ngrowth, or f = the return on the market portfolio (CAPM). Notice that\nwe run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt\nabout predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in \u2018\u2018good times\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018bad times\u2019\u2019 as measured by the factors.\nThe point of the beta model (5.1) is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i = 1, 2, . . . , N in (5.1) to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in (5.1) are the explanatory (x) variables, which vary asset by asset. The \u03b3 and \u03bb\u2014common for all assets\u2014are the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation (5.1) says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all (E(Ri),\u03b2i) pairs to line up on a straight line with slope \u03bb and intercept \u03b3 .\n\u03b2i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and \u03bba is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure.

One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1 = E(mRW ) and 1 = E (m )R f . [For example, see equation (8.3).] In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, S&P500, etc.\nThe CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,\n\u0001\u0002\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2 W E(RW)\u2212\u03b3. i,R\nThis section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutility(RW here),andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor.\nI present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by (1) two-period quadratic utility; (2) two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; (3) infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; (4) log utility.",
        "9\nFactor Pricing Models\nIn Chapter 2, I noted that the consumption-based model, while a complete answer to most asset pricing questions in principle, does not (yet) work well in practice. This observation motivates efforts to tie the discount factor m to other data. Linear factor pricing models are the most popular models of this sort in finance. They dominate discrete-time empirical work.\nFactor pricing models replace the consumption-based expression for marginal utility growth with a linear model of the form\nmt+1 =a+b\u2032ft+1.\na and b are free parameters. As we saw in Chapter 6, this specification is\nequivalent to a multiple-beta model\nE(Rt+1) = \u03b3 + \u03b2\u2032\u03bb,\nwhere \u03b2 are multiple regression coefficients of returns R on the factors f , and \u03b3 and \u03bb are free parameters.\nThe big question is, what should one use for factors ft+1? Factor pricing models look for variables that are good proxies for aggregate marginal utility growth, i.e., variables for which\nu\u2032(ct+1) u\u2032(ct)\nis a sensible and economically interpretable approximation.\nMore directly, the essence of asset pricing is that there are spe- cial states of the world in which investors are especially concerned that their portfolios not do badly. They are willing to trade off some overall performance\u2014average return\u2014to make sure that portfolios do not do badly in these particular states of nature.

We could now go from m linear in the factors to an expected return- beta model using the connections between the two representations outlined in Chapter 6. But there is a more direct and elegant connection. Start with (9.20), specialized to returns x i = R i and of course p (R i ) = 1.

        "78 5. Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations 5.1 Expected Return-Beta Representations\n   The expected return-beta expression of a factor pricing model is E(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\nThe model is equivalent to a restriction that the intercept is the same for all assets in time-series regressions.\nWhen the factors are excess returns, then \u03bba = E ( f a ). If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero, \u03b1 = 0.\n     Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, i=1,2,...,N. (5.1) The \u03b2 terms are defined as the coefficients in a multiple regression of\nreturns on factors,\nRi =a +\u03b2 fa +\u03b2 fb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+\u03b5i, t =1,2,...,T.

The \u2018\u2018factors\u2019\u2019 f are proxies for marginal utility\ngrowth. I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9.\nFor the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f = consumption\ngrowth, or f = the return on the market portfolio (CAPM). Notice that\nwe run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt\nabout predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in \u2018\u2018good times\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018bad times\u2019\u2019 as measured by the factors.\nThe point of the beta model (5.1) is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i = 1, 2, . . . , N in (5.1) to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in (5.1) are the explanatory (x) variables, which vary asset by asset. The \u03b3 and \u03bb\u2014common for all assets\u2014are the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation (5.1) says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all (E(Ri),\u03b2i) pairs to line up on a straight line with slope \u03bb and intercept \u03b3 .\n\u03b2i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and \u03bba is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure.

If a risk-free rate is traded, we can simply observe that it is not infinite and verify the fact. Also, in a complete market, E(m) cannot be zero since, by absence of arbitrage, m > 0.

For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by (1) two-period quadratic utility; (2) two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; (3) infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; (4) log utility.",
        "9\nFactor Pricing Models\nIn Chapter 2, I noted that the consumption-based model, while a complete answer to most asset pricing questions in principle, does not (yet) work well in practice. This observation motivates efforts to tie the discount factor m to other data. Linear factor pricing models are the most popular models of this sort in finance. They dominate discrete-time empirical work.\nFactor pricing models replace the consumption-based expression for marginal utility growth with a linear model of the form\nmt+1 =a+b\u2032ft+1.\na and b are free parameters. As we saw in Chapter 6, this specification is\nequivalent to a multiple-beta model\nE(Rt+1) = \u03b3 + \u03b2\u2032\u03bb,\nwhere \u03b2 are multiple regression coefficients of returns R on the factors f , and \u03b3 and \u03bb are free parameters.\nThe big question is, what should one use for factors ft+1? Factor pricing models look for variables that are good proxies for aggregate marginal utility growth, i.e., variables for which\nu\u2032(ct+1) u\u2032(ct)\nis a sensible and economically interpretable approximation.\nMore directly, the essence of asset pricing is that there are spe- cial states of the world in which investors are especially concerned that their portfolios not do badly. They are willing to trade off some overall performance\u2014average return\u2014to make sure that portfolios do not do badly in these particular states of nature.

Something like the consumption-based model\u2014investors\u2019 first-order conditions for savings and portfolio choice\u2014has to be the starting point.\nRather than dream up models, test them, and reject them, financial economists since the work of Mehra and Prescott (1985) and Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) have been able to work backwards to some extent, char- acterizing the properties that discount factors must have in order to explain asset return data. Among other things, we learned that the discount factor had to be extremely volatile, while not too conditionally volatile; the risk-free rate or conditional mean had to be pretty steady.

Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa.\n6.

It ties the discount factor m to the return on the \u2018\u2018wealth portfolio.\u2019\u2019 The function is linear,\nm =a+bRW . t+1 t+1\na and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1 = E(mRW ) and 1 = E (m )R f . [For example, see equation (8.3).] In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, S&P500, etc.\nThe CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,\n\u0001\u0002\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2 W E(RW)\u2212\u03b3. i,R\nThis section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM.

Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return.

        "80 5. Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations\nWe can impose this condition rather than estimate \u03b3 in the cross-sectional regression (5.3). If there is no risk-free rate, then \u03b3 must be estimated in the cross-sectional regression. Since it is the expected return of a portfolio with zero betas on all factors, \u03b3 is called the (expected) zero-beta rate in this circumstance.\nWe often examine factor pricing models using excess returns directly. (There is an implicit, though not necessarily justified, division of labor between models of interest rates and models of equity risk premia.) Differencing (5.1) between any two returns R ei = R i \u2212 R j (R j does not have to be risk free), we obtain\nE(Rei)=\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, i=1,2,...,N. (5.4)\nHere, \u03b2ia represents the regression coefficient of the excess return Rei on the factors. This formulation removes the intercept \u03b3 .\nIt is often the case that the factors are also returns or excess returns. For example, the CAPM uses the return on the market portfolio as the single factor. In this case, the model should apply to the factors as well, and this fact allows us to measure the \u03bb coefficients directly rather than via a cross- sectional regression. Each factor has beta of one on itself and zero on all the other factors, of course. Therefore, if the factors are excess returns, we have E(f a) = \u03bba, and so forth. We can then write the factor model as\nE (R ei ) = \u03b2i , a E ( f a ) + \u03b2i , b E ( f b ) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , i = 1, 2, . . . , N . (5.5)\nThe cross-sectional beta pricing model (5.1)--(5.5) and the time-series regression definition of the betas in (5.2) look very similar. It seems that one can take expectations of the time-series regression (5.2) and arrive at the beta model (5.1), in which case the latter would be vacuous since one can always run a regression of anything on anything. The difference is subtle but crucial: the time-series regressions (5.2) will in general have a different intercept ai for each return i, while the intercept \u03b3 is the same for all assets in the beta pricing equation (5.1). The beta pricing equation is a restriction on expected returns, and thus imposes a restriction on intercepts in the time-series regression.\nIn the special case that the factors are themselves excess returns, the restriction is particularly simple: the time-series regression intercepts should all be zero. In this case, we can avoid the cross-sectional regression entirely, since there are no free parameters left."

However, since we want a connection to the beta representation based on covariances rather than second moments, it is easiest to fold means of the factors in to the constant, and write m = a + b \u2032 f with E(f ) = 0 and hence E(m) = a.\nThe connection is easiest to see in the special case that all the test assets are excess returns. Then 0 = E(mRe) does not identify the mean of m, and we can normalize a arbitrarily. I find it convenient to normalize to E (m ) = 1, orm=1+b\u2032[f \u2212E(f)].Then,\n    Beta pricing models are equivalent to linear models for the discount factor m,\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03bb\u2032\u03b2i \u21d4m=a+b\u2032f.\n   using m,x , or R as factors. Let us ask the converse question: suppose we have an expected return-beta model such as CAPM, APT, ICAPM, etc. What discount factor does this model imply? I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work.\nTheorem: Given the model\nm=1+[f \u2212E(f)]\u2032b, 0=E(mRe),\none can find \u03bb such that\nE(Re) = \u03b2\u2032\u03bb,\nwhere \u03b2 are the multiple regression coefficients of excess returns Re on the factors.

The payoffs are typically returns or excess returns, including returns scaled by instruments.

The obvious set of moments to use are the pricing errors,\ng (b)=ET(xf\u2032b\u2212p). T\nThis choice is natural but not necessary. You do not have to use p = E(mx) with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p = E(mx). You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p = E (mx ). It is a choice, and the results will depend on this choice of moments as well as the specification of the model.\nThe GMM estimate is formed from\nming (b)\u2032Wg (b)\nb\nwith first-order condition\nd\u2032Wg (b)=d\u2032W ET(xf\u2032b\u2212p)=0,\nT\nwhere\nThis is the second-moment matrix of payoffs and factors.

Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa.\n6.

Since the beta model applies to every return including Rmv itself, and Rmv has a beta of 1 on itself, we can identify the factor risk premiumas\u03bb=E(Rmv \u2212Rf).\nThe last two points suggest an intimate relationship between discount factors, beta models, and mean-variance frontiers.

Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe CAPM, credited to Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965a, b), is the first, most famous, and (so far) most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the \u2018\u2018wealth portfolio.\u2019\u2019 The function is linear,\nm =a+bRW . t+1 t+1\na and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1 = E(mRW ) and 1 = E (m )R f . [For example, see equation (8.3).] In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, S&P500, etc.\nThe CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,\n\u0001\u0002\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2 W E(RW)\u2212\u03b3. i,R\nThis section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutility(RW here),andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor.\nI present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by (1) two-period quadratic utility; (2) two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; (3) infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; (4) log utility.",

Since each point on the mean-variance frontier is perfectly correlated\nwith the discount factor, we must be able to pick constants a , b , d , e such that\nm = a + bR mv , Rmv =d+em.\nThus, any mean-variance efficient return carries all pricing information. Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa.\n6. Given a discount factor, we can also construct a single-beta representa- tion, so expected returns can be described in a single-beta representation using any mean-variance efficient return (except the risk-free rate),\n\u0003\u0004\nE(Ri)=Rf +\u03b2i,mv E(Rmv)\u2212Rf .\nThe essence of the beta pricing model is that, even though the means and standard deviations of returns fill out the space inside the mean- variance frontier, a graph of mean returns versus betas should yield a straight line. Since the beta model applies to every return including Rmv itself, and Rmv has a beta of 1 on itself, we can identify the factor risk premiumas\u03bb=E(Rmv \u2212Rf).\nThe last two points suggest an intimate relationship between discount factors, beta models, and mean-variance frontiers. I explore this relation in detail in Chapter 6. A problem at the end of this chapter guides you through the algebra to demonstrate points 5 and 6 explicitly.\n7.

Assets inside the frontier or even on the lower portion of the frontier are not \u2018\u2018worse\u2019\u2019 than assets on the frontier. The frontier and its internal region characterize equilibrium asset returns, with rational investors happy to hold all assets.

        "9\nFactor Pricing Models\nIn Chapter 2, I noted that the consumption-based model, while a complete answer to most asset pricing questions in principle, does not (yet) work well in practice. This observation motivates efforts to tie the discount factor m to other data. Linear factor pricing models are the most popular models of this sort in finance. They dominate discrete-time empirical work.\nFactor pricing models replace the consumption-based expression for marginal utility growth with a linear model of the form\nmt+1 =a+b\u2032ft+1.\na and b are free parameters. As we saw in Chapter 6, this specification is\nequivalent to a multiple-beta model\nE(Rt+1) = \u03b3 + \u03b2\u2032\u03bb,\nwhere \u03b2 are multiple regression coefficients of returns R on the factors f , and \u03b3 and \u03bb are free parameters.\nThe big question is, what should one use for factors ft+1? Factor pricing models look for variables that are good proxies for aggregate marginal utility growth, i.e., variables for which\nu\u2032(ct+1) u\u2032(ct)\nis a sensible and economically interpretable approximation.\nMore directly, the essence of asset pricing is that there are spe- cial states of the world in which investors are especially concerned that their portfolios not do badly. They are willing to trade off some overall performance\u2014average return\u2014to make sure that portfolios do not do badly in these particular states of nature. The factors are variables that indicate\nthat these \u2018\u2018bad states\u2019\u2019 have occurred. 149\n\u03b2\n\u2248 a + b\u2032ft+1 (9.1)",

However, since we want a connection to the beta representation based on covariances rather than second moments, it is easiest to fold means of the factors in to the constant, and write m = a + b \u2032 f with E(f ) = 0 and hence E(m) = a.\nThe connection is easiest to see in the special case that all the test assets are excess returns. Then 0 = E(mRe) does not identify the mean of m, and we can normalize a arbitrarily. I find it convenient to normalize to E (m ) = 1, orm=1+b\u2032[f \u2212E(f)].Then,\n    Beta pricing models are equivalent to linear models for the discount factor m,\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03bb\u2032\u03b2i \u21d4m=a+b\u2032f.\n   using m,x , or R as factors. Let us ask the converse question: suppose we have an expected return-beta model such as CAPM, APT, ICAPM, etc. What discount factor does this model imply? I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work.\nTheorem: Given the model\nm=1+[f \u2212E(f)]\u2032b, 0=E(mRe),\none can find \u03bb such that\nE(Re) = \u03b2\u2032\u03bb,\nwhere \u03b2 are the multiple regression coefficients of excess returns Re on the factors.

Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe CAPM, credited to Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965a, b), is the first, most famous, and (so far) most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the \u2018\u2018wealth portfolio.\u2019\u2019 The function is linear,\nm =a+bRW . t+1 t+1\na and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1 = E(mRW ) and 1 = E (m )R f . [For example, see equation (8.3).] In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, S&P500, etc.\nThe CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,\n\u0001\u0002\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2 W E(RW)\u2212\u03b3. i,R\nThis section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutility(RW here),andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor.\nI present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by (1) two-period quadratic utility; (2) two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; (3) infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; (4) log utility.",

Since each point on the mean-variance frontier is perfectly correlated\nwith the discount factor, we must be able to pick constants a , b , d , e such that\nm = a + bR mv , Rmv =d+em.\nThus, any mean-variance efficient return carries all pricing information. Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa.\n6. Given a discount factor, we can also construct a single-beta representa- tion, so expected returns can be described in a single-beta representation using any mean-variance efficient return (except the risk-free rate),\n\u0003\u0004\nE(Ri)=Rf +\u03b2i,mv E(Rmv)\u2212Rf .\nThe essence of the beta pricing model is that, even though the means and standard deviations of returns fill out the space inside the mean- variance frontier, a graph of mean returns versus betas should yield a straight line. Since the beta model applies to every return including Rmv itself, and Rmv has a beta of 1 on itself, we can identify the factor risk premiumas\u03bb=E(Rmv \u2212Rf).\nThe last two points suggest an intimate relationship between discount factors, beta models, and mean-variance frontiers.

This chapter introduces expected return-beta representations and mean-variance frontiers.\nI discuss here the beta representation of factor pricing models. Chapters 6 and 9 discuss where the factor models came from. Chapter 6 shows how an expected return-beta model is equivalent to a linear model for the discount factor, i.e., m = b\u2032f . Chapter 9 discusses the derivation of popular factor models such as the CAPM, ICAPM, and APT, i.e., under what assumptions thediscountfactorisalinearfunctionofothervariablesf suchasthemarket return.\nI summarize the classic Lagrangian approach to the mean-variance frontier. I then introduce a powerful and useful representation of the mean- variance frontier due to Hansen and Richard (1987). This representation uses the state-space geometry familiar from the existence theorems. It is also useful because it is valid in infinite-dimensional payoff spaces, which we shall soon encounter when we add conditioning information, dynamic trading, or options.\n 77",

The payoffs are typically returns or excess returns, including returns scaled by instruments. The prices are typically one (returns), zero (excess returns), or instruments.\nTo implement GMM, we need to choose a set of moments. The obvious set of moments to use are the pricing errors,\ng (b)=ET(xf\u2032b\u2212p). T\nThis choice is natural but not necessary. You do not have to use p = E(mx) with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p = E(mx). You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p = E (mx ). It is a choice, and the results will depend on this choice of moments as well as the specification of the model.\nThe GMM estimate is formed from\nming (b)\u2032Wg (b)\nb\nwith first-order condition\nd\u2032Wg (b)=d\u2032W ET(xf\u2032b\u2212p)=0,\nT\nwhere\nThis is the second-moment matrix of payoffs and factors.

What could be more sensible? The model (13.1) says that average prices should be a linear function of the second moment of payoff with factors, so the estimate runs a linear regression. These are cross-sectional regressions since they operate across assets on sample averages.

Then 0 = E(mRe) does not identify the mean of m, and we can normalize a arbitrarily. I find it convenient to normalize to E (m ) = 1, orm=1+b\u2032[f \u2212E(f)].Then,\n    Beta pricing models are equivalent to linear models for the discount factor m,\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03bb\u2032\u03b2i \u21d4m=a+b\u2032f.\n   using m,x , or R as factors.

I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work.\nTheorem: Given the model\nm=1+[f \u2212E(f)]\u2032b, 0=E(mRe),\none can find \u03bb such that\nE(Re) = \u03b2\u2032\u03bb,\nwhere \u03b2 are the multiple regression coefficients of excess returns Re on the factors.

If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero, \u03b1 = 0.\n     Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, i=1,2,...,N.

I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9.\nFor the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f = consumption\ngrowth, or f = the return on the market portfolio (CAPM). Notice that\nwe run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt\nabout predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time.

I write i = 1, 2, . . . , N in (5.1) to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in (5.1) are the explanatory (x) variables, which vary asset by asset. The \u03b3 and \u03bb\u2014common for all assets\u2014are the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation (5.1) says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all (E(Ri),\u03b2i) pairs to line up on a straight line with slope \u03bb and intercept \u03b3 .\n\u03b2i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and \u03bba is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure.

The latter is particularly nice in the case of a linear factor model, since we may consider the constant as a factor, so the frontier is entirely generated by factor-mimicking portfolio returns.\n6.5 Three Risk-Free Rate Analogues\n    I introduce three counterparts to the risk-free rate that show up in asset pricing formulas when there is no risk-free rate. The three returns are the zero-beta return, the minimum-variance return, and the constant-mimicking portfolio return.\n   Three different generalizations of the risk-free rate are useful when a risk-free rate or unit payoff is not in the set of payoffs. These are the zero-beta return, the minimum-variance return, and the constant-mimicking portfolio return. I introduce the returns in this section, and I use them in the next section to state some special cases involving the mean-variance frontier. Each of these returns maintains one property of the risk-free rate in a market in which there is no risk-free rate. The zero-beta return is a mean-variance effi- cient return that is uncorrelated with another given mean-variance efficient return. The minimum-variance return is just that. The constant-mimicking portfolio return is the return on the payoff \u2018\u2018closest\u2019\u2019 to the unit payoff. Each of these returns has a representation in the standard form R \u2217 + wR e \u2217 with slightly different w. In addition, the expected returns of these risky assets are used in some asset pricing representations. For example, the zero-beta rate is often used to refer to the expected value of the zero-beta return.\nEach of these risk-free rate analogues is mean-variance efficient. Thus, I characterize each one by finding its weight w in a representation of the form R\u2217 + wRe\u2217. We derived such a representation above for the risk-free rate as equation (5.20),\nRf =R\u2217+RfRe\u2217.

Since each point on the mean-variance frontier is perfectly correlated\nwith the discount factor, we must be able to pick constants a , b , d , e such that\nm = a + bR mv , Rmv =d+em.\nThus, any mean-variance efficient return carries all pricing information. Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa.\n6. Given a discount factor, we can also construct a single-beta representa- tion, so expected returns can be described in a single-beta representation using any mean-variance efficient return (except the risk-free rate),\n\u0003\u0004\nE(Ri)=Rf +\u03b2i,mv E(Rmv)\u2212Rf .\nThe essence of the beta pricing model is that, even though the means and standard deviations of returns fill out the space inside the mean- variance frontier, a graph of mean returns versus betas should yield a straight line. Since the beta model applies to every return including Rmv itself, and Rmv has a beta of 1 on itself, we can identify the factor risk premiumas\u03bb=E(Rmv \u2212Rf).\nThe last two points suggest an intimate relationship between discount factors, beta models, and mean-variance frontiers.

However, since we want a connection to the beta representation based on covariances rather than second moments, it is easiest to fold means of the factors in to the constant, and write m = a + b \u2032 f with E(f ) = 0 and hence E(m) = a.\nThe connection is easiest to see in the special case that all the test assets are excess returns. Then 0 = E(mRe) does not identify the mean of m, and we can normalize a arbitrarily. I find it convenient to normalize to E (m ) = 1, orm=1+b\u2032[f \u2212E(f)].Then,\n    Beta pricing models are equivalent to linear models for the discount factor m,\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03bb\u2032\u03b2i \u21d4m=a+b\u2032f.\n   using m,x , or R as factors. Let us ask the converse question: suppose we have an expected return-beta model such as CAPM, APT, ICAPM, etc. What discount factor does this model imply? I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work.\nTheorem: Given the model\nm=1+[f \u2212E(f)]\u2032b, 0=E(mRe),\none can find \u03bb such that\nE(Re) = \u03b2\u2032\u03bb,\nwhere \u03b2 are the multiple regression coefficients of excess returns Re on the factors.

        "152 9. Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe CAPM, credited to Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965a, b), is the first, most famous, and (so far) most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the \u2018\u2018wealth portfolio.\u2019\u2019 The function is linear,\nm =a+bRW . t+1 t+1\na and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1 = E(mRW ) and 1 = E (m )R f . [For example, see equation (8.3).] In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, S&P500, etc.\nThe CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,\n\u0001\u0002\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2 W E(RW)\u2212\u03b3. i,R\nThis section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutility(RW here),andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor.\nI present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by (1) two-period quadratic utility; (2) two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; (3) infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; (4) log utility.",

The trouble is that in this case the mean discount factor is not identified. If E(mRe ) = 0, then E((2 \u00d7 m)Re ) = 0. Analogously in expected return-beta models, if all test assets are excess returns, then we have no\ninformation on the level of the zero-beta rate.\nWriting out the model as m = a \u2212 b\u2032f , we cannot separately identify\na and b so we have to choose some normalization.

The obvious set of moments to use are the pricing errors,\ng (b)=ET(xf\u2032b\u2212p). T\nThis choice is natural but not necessary. You do not have to use p = E(mx) with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p = E(mx). You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p = E (mx ).

Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return.

It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, S&P500, etc.\nThe CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,\n\u0001\u0002\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2 W E(RW)\u2212\u03b3. i,R\nThis section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutility(RW here),andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor.\nI present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by (1) two-period quadratic utility; (2) two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; (3) infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; (4) log utility.",

The payoffs are typically returns or excess returns, including returns scaled by instruments. The prices are typically one (returns), zero (excess returns), or instruments.\nTo implement GMM, we need to choose a set of moments. The obvious set of moments to use are the pricing errors,\ng (b)=ET(xf\u2032b\u2212p). T\nThis choice is natural but not necessary. You do not have to use p = E(mx) with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p = E(mx). You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p = E (mx ). It is a choice, and the results will depend on this choice of moments as well as the specification of the model.\nThe GMM estimate is formed from\nming (b)\u2032Wg (b)\nb\nwith first-order condition\nd\u2032Wg (b)=d\u2032W ET(xf\u2032b\u2212p)=0,\nT\nwhere\nThis is the second-moment matrix of payoffs and factors.

What could be more sensible? The model (13.1) says that average prices should be a linear function of the second moment of payoff with factors, so the estimate runs a linear regression.

This chapter introduces expected return-beta representations and mean-variance frontiers.\nI discuss here the beta representation of factor pricing models. Chapters 6 and 9 discuss where the factor models came from. Chapter 6 shows how an expected return-beta model is equivalent to a linear model for the discount factor, i.e., m = b\u2032f . Chapter 9 discusses the derivation of popular factor models such as the CAPM, ICAPM, and APT, i.e., under what assumptions thediscountfactorisalinearfunctionofothervariablesf suchasthemarket return.\nI summarize the classic Lagrangian approach to the mean-variance frontier. I then introduce a powerful and useful representation of the mean- variance frontier due to Hansen and Richard (1987). This representation uses the state-space geometry familiar from the existence theorems. It is also useful because it is valid in infinite-dimensional payoff spaces, which we shall soon encounter when we add conditioning information, dynamic trading, or options.\n 77",

The other formulas are the same.\n     The analysis of the last section requires that at least one asset has a nonzeroprice.Ifallassetsareexcessreturns,thenb\u02c6 =(d\u2032d)\u22121d\u2032E (p)=0.\n1T\nLinear factor models are most often applied to excess returns, so this case is important. The trouble is that in this case the mean discount factor is not identified. If E(mRe ) = 0, then E((2 \u00d7 m)Re ) = 0. Analogously in expected return-beta models, if all test assets are excess returns, then we have no\ninformation on the level of the zero-beta rate.\nWriting out the model as m = a \u2212 b\u2032f , we cannot separately identify\na and b so we have to choose some normalization. The choice is entirely one of convenience; lack of identification means precisely that the pricing errors do not depend on the choice of normalization.\nThe easiest choice is a = 1. Then\ng (b)=\u2212ET(mRe)=\u2212ET(Re)+E(Ref\u2032)b.\nT\n(The \u2212 sign makes the resulting formulas prettier.) We have\n\u2202b\u2032\nthe second-moment matrix of returns and factors.

        "20.2. The Cross Section: CAPM and Multifactor Models 445\nI have focused on the size and value factors since they provide the most empirically successful multifactor model to date, and have therefore attracted much attention.\nSeveral authors have used macroeconomic variables as factors in order to examine directly the story that stock performance during bad macroeco- nomic times determines average returns. Jagannathan and Wang (1996) and Reyfman (1997) use labor income; Chen, Roll, and Ross (1986) use indus- trial production and inflation among other variables. Cochrane (1996) uses investment growth. All these authors find that average returns line up against betas calculated using these macroeconomic indicators. The factors are the- oretically easier to motivate, but none explains the value and size portfolios as well as the (theoretically less solid, so far) size and value factors.\nLettau and Ludvigson (2001a) specify a macroeconomic model that does just as well as the Fama\u2013French factors in explaining the 25 Fama\u2013 French portfolios. Their plots of actual average returns versus model pre- dictions show a relation as strong as those of Figures 20.12 and 20.13. Their model is\nmt+1 =a+b(cay)\u0005ct+1, t\nwhere cay is a measure of the consumption-wealth ratio. This is a \u2018\u2018scaled factor model\u2019\u2019 of the sort advocated in Chapter 8. You can think of it as capturing a time-varying risk aversion.\nThough Merton\u2019s (1971, 1973a) theory says that variables which predict market returns should show up as factors which explain cross-sectional vari- ation in average returns, surprisingly few papers have actually tried to see whether this is true, now that we do have variables that we think forecast the market return. Campbell (1996) and Ferson and Harvey (1999) are among the few exceptions.\nMomentum and Reversal\nSince a string of good returns gives a high price, it is not surprising that stocks that do well for a long time (and hence build up a high price) subsequently do poorly, and stocks that do poorly for a long time (and\n   Sorting stocks based on past performance, you find that a portfolio that buys long-term losers and sells long-term winners does better than the opposite\u2014individual stock long-term returns mean-revert.

However, a port- folio that buys short-term winners and sells short-term losers also does well\u2014\u2018\u2018momentum.\u2019\u2019 This effect is a puzzle.",
        "12\nRegression-Based Tests of Linear Factor Models\nThe next four chapters study the question, how should we estimate and evaluate linear factor models: models of the form p = E(mx), m = b\u2032f or equivalently E(Re) = \u03b2\u2032\u03bb? These models are by far the most common in empirical asset pricing, and there is a large literature on econometric tech- niques to estimate and evaluate them. Each technique focuses on the same questions: how to estimate parameters, how to calculate standard errors of the estimated parameters, how to calculate standard errors of the pricing errors, and how to test the model, usually with a test statistic of the form \u03b1\u02c6 \u2032 V \u2212 1 \u03b1\u02c6 .\nI start in this chapter with simple and long-standing time-series and cross-sectional regression tests. In Chapter 13, I pursue the GMM approach to the model expressed in p = E(mx), m = b\u2032f form. Chapter 14 summa- rizes the principle of maximum likelihood estimation and derives maximum likelihood estimates and tests. Finally, Chapter 15 compares the different approaches.\nAs always, the theme is the underlying unity. All of the techniques come down to one of two basic ideas: time-series regression or cross-sectional regression. Time-series regression turns out to be a limiting case of cross- sectional regression. The GMM, p = E (mx ) approach turns out to be almost identical to cross-sectional regressions. Maximum likelihood (with appro- priate statistical assumptions) justifies the time-series and cross-sectional regression approaches. The formulas for parameter estimates, standard errors, and test statistics are all strikingly similar.\n 229",

        "152 9. Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe CAPM, credited to Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965a, b), is the first, most famous, and (so far) most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the \u2018\u2018wealth portfolio.\u2019\u2019 The function is linear,\nm =a+bRW . t+1 t+1\na and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1 = E(mRW ) and 1 = E (m )R f . [For example, see equation (8.3).] In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, S&P500, etc.\nThe CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,\n\u0001\u0002\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2 W E(RW)\u2212\u03b3. i,R\nThis section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutility(RW here),andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor.\nI present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by (1) two-period quadratic utility; (2) two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; (3) infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; (4) log utility.",

Comparing this graph with the similar Figure 2.4 of the consumption-based model, the CAPM fits very well.\nIn fact, Figure 20.8 captures one of the first significant failures of the CAPM. The smallest firms (the far right portfolio) seem to earn an average return a few percent too high given their betas. This is the celebrated \u2018\u2018small- firm effect\u2019\u2019 (Banz [1981]). Would that all failed economic theories worked so well! It is also atypical in that the estimated market line through the stock portfolios is steeper than predicted, while measurement error in betas usually means that the estimated market line is too flat.\nFama\u2013French 3 Factors\nIn retrospect, it is surprising that the CAPM worked so well for so long. The assumptions on which it is built are very stylized and simplified. Asset pricing theory recognized at least since Merton (1971, 1973a) the theoretical possibility, indeed probability, that we should need factors, state variables, or sources of priced risk beyond movements in the market portfolio in order to explain why some average returns are higher than others.\nThe Fama\u2013French model is one of the most popular multifactor models that now dominate empirical research. Fama and French (1993) presents the model; Fama and French (1996) gives an excellent summary, and also shows how the three-factor model performs in evaluating expected return puzzles beyond the size and value effects that motivated it.\n\u2018\u2018Value\u2019\u2019 stocks have market values that are small relative to the accoun- tant\u2019s book value. (Book values essentially track past investment expen- ditures. Book value is a better divisor for individual-firm price than are dividends or earnings, which can be negative.) This category of stocks has given large average returns. \u2018\u2018Growth\u2019\u2019 stocks are the opposite of value and have had low average returns. Since low prices relative to dividends, earnings, or book value forecast times when the market return will be high, it is natural to suppose that these same signals forecast categories of stocks that will do well; the \u2018\u2018value effect\u2019\u2019 is the cross-sectional analogy to price-ratio predictability in the time series.\n   Book market sorted portfolios show a large variation in average returns that is unrelated to market betas. The Fama and French three-factor model successfully explains the average returns of the 25 size and book market sorted portfolios with a three-factor model, consisting of the market, a small minus big (SMB) portfolio, and a high minus low (HML) portfolio."

However, since we want a connection to the beta representation based on covariances rather than second moments, it is easiest to fold means of the factors in to the constant, and write m = a + b \u2032 f with E(f ) = 0 and hence E(m) = a.\nThe connection is easiest to see in the special case that all the test assets are excess returns. Then 0 = E(mRe) does not identify the mean of m, and we can normalize a arbitrarily. I find it convenient to normalize to E (m ) = 1, orm=1+b\u2032[f \u2212E(f)].Then,\n    Beta pricing models are equivalent to linear models for the discount factor m,\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03bb\u2032\u03b2i \u21d4m=a+b\u2032f.\n   using m,x , or R as factors. Let us ask the converse question: suppose we have an expected return-beta model such as CAPM, APT, ICAPM, etc. What discount factor does this model imply? I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work.\nTheorem: Given the model\nm=1+[f \u2212E(f)]\u2032b, 0=E(mRe),\none can find \u03bb such that\nE(Re) = \u03b2\u2032\u03bb,\nwhere \u03b2 are the multiple regression coefficients of excess returns Re on the factors.

If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero, \u03b1 = 0.\n     Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, i=1,2,...,N.

The \u2018\u2018factors\u2019\u2019 f are proxies for marginal utility\ngrowth. I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9.\nFor the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f = consumption\ngrowth, or f = the return on the market portfolio (CAPM). Notice that\nwe run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt\nabout predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in \u2018\u2018good times\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018bad times\u2019\u2019 as measured by the factors.\nThe point of the beta model (5.1) is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i = 1, 2, . . . , N in (5.1) to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in (5.1) are the explanatory (x) variables, which vary asset by asset. The \u03b3 and \u03bb\u2014common for all assets\u2014are the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation (5.1) says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all (E(Ri),\u03b2i) pairs to line up on a straight line with slope \u03bb and intercept \u03b3 .\n\u03b2i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and \u03bba is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure.

        "80 5. Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations\nWe can impose this condition rather than estimate \u03b3 in the cross-sectional regression (5.3). If there is no risk-free rate, then \u03b3 must be estimated in the cross-sectional regression. Since it is the expected return of a portfolio with zero betas on all factors, \u03b3 is called the (expected) zero-beta rate in this circumstance.\nWe often examine factor pricing models using excess returns directly. (There is an implicit, though not necessarily justified, division of labor between models of interest rates and models of equity risk premia.) Differencing (5.1) between any two returns R ei = R i \u2212 R j (R j does not have to be risk free), we obtain\nE(Rei)=\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, i=1,2,...,N. (5.4)\nHere, \u03b2ia represents the regression coefficient of the excess return Rei on the factors. This formulation removes the intercept \u03b3 .\nIt is often the case that the factors are also returns or excess returns. For example, the CAPM uses the return on the market portfolio as the single factor. In this case, the model should apply to the factors as well, and this fact allows us to measure the \u03bb coefficients directly rather than via a cross- sectional regression. Each factor has beta of one on itself and zero on all the other factors, of course. Therefore, if the factors are excess returns, we have E(f a) = \u03bba, and so forth. We can then write the factor model as\nE (R ei ) = \u03b2i , a E ( f a ) + \u03b2i , b E ( f b ) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , i = 1, 2, . . . , N . (5.5)\nThe cross-sectional beta pricing model (5.1)--(5.5) and the time-series regression definition of the betas in (5.2) look very similar. It seems that one can take expectations of the time-series regression (5.2) and arrive at the beta model (5.1), in which case the latter would be vacuous since one can always run a regression of anything on anything. The difference is subtle but crucial: the time-series regressions (5.2) will in general have a different intercept ai for each return i, while the intercept \u03b3 is the same for all assets in the beta pricing equation (5.1). The beta pricing equation is a restriction on expected returns, and thus imposes a restriction on intercepts in the time-series regression.\nIn the special case that the factors are themselves excess returns, the restriction is particularly simple: the time-series regression intercepts should all be zero. In this case, we can avoid the cross-sectional regression entirely, since there are no free parameters left.",

The payoffs are typically returns or excess returns, including returns scaled by instruments. The prices are typically one (returns), zero (excess returns), or instruments.\nTo implement GMM, we need to choose a set of moments. The obvious set of moments to use are the pricing errors,\ng (b)=ET(xf\u2032b\u2212p). T\nThis choice is natural but not necessary. You do not have to use p = E(mx) with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p = E(mx). You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p = E (mx ).

Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe CAPM, credited to Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965a, b), is the first, most famous, and (so far) most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the \u2018\u2018wealth portfolio.\u2019\u2019 The function is linear,\nm =a+bRW . t+1 t+1\na and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1 = E(mRW ) and 1 = E (m )R f . [For example, see equation (8.3).] In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, S&P500, etc.\nThe CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,\n\u0001\u0002\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2 W E(RW)\u2212\u03b3. i,R\nThis section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutility(RW here),andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor.\nI present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by (1) two-period quadratic utility; (2) two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; (3) infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; (4) log utility.",

Since each point on the mean-variance frontier is perfectly correlated\nwith the discount factor, we must be able to pick constants a , b , d , e such that\nm = a + bR mv , Rmv =d+em.\nThus, any mean-variance efficient return carries all pricing information. Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa.\n6. Given a discount factor, we can also construct a single-beta representa- tion, so expected returns can be described in a single-beta representation using any mean-variance efficient return (except the risk-free rate),\n\u0003\u0004\nE(Ri)=Rf +\u03b2i,mv E(Rmv)\u2212Rf .\nThe essence of the beta pricing model is that, even though the means and standard deviations of returns fill out the space inside the mean- variance frontier, a graph of mean returns versus betas should yield a straight line. Since the beta model applies to every return including Rmv itself, and Rmv has a beta of 1 on itself, we can identify the factor risk premiumas\u03bb=E(Rmv \u2212Rf).\nThe last two points suggest an intimate relationship between discount factors, beta models, and mean-variance frontiers. I explore this relation in detail in Chapter 6. A problem at the end of this chapter guides you through the algebra to demonstrate points 5 and 6 explicitly.\n7.

If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero, \u03b1 = 0.\n     Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, i=1,2,...,N.

I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9.\nFor the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f = consumption\ngrowth, or f = the return on the market portfolio (CAPM). Notice that\nwe run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt\nabout predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in \u2018\u2018good times\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018bad times\u2019\u2019 as measured by the factors.\nThe point of the beta model (5.1) is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i = 1, 2, . . . , N in (5.1) to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in (5.1) are the explanatory (x) variables, which vary asset by asset. The \u03b3 and \u03bb\u2014common for all assets\u2014are the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation (5.1) says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all (E(Ri),\u03b2i) pairs to line up on a straight line with slope \u03bb and intercept \u03b3 .\n\u03b2i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and \u03bba is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure.

This chapter introduces expected return-beta representations and mean-variance frontiers.\nI discuss here the beta representation of factor pricing models. Chapters 6 and 9 discuss where the factor models came from. Chapter 6 shows how an expected return-beta model is equivalent to a linear model for the discount factor, i.e., m = b\u2032f . Chapter 9 discusses the derivation of popular factor models such as the CAPM, ICAPM, and APT, i.e., under what assumptions thediscountfactorisalinearfunctionofothervariablesf suchasthemarket return.\nI summarize the classic Lagrangian approach to the mean-variance frontier. I then introduce a powerful and useful representation of the mean- variance frontier due to Hansen and Richard (1987). This representation uses the state-space geometry familiar from the existence theorems. It is also useful because it is valid in infinite-dimensional payoff spaces, which we shall soon encounter when we add conditioning information, dynamic trading, or options.\n 77",

        "9\nFactor Pricing Models\nIn Chapter 2, I noted that the consumption-based model, while a complete answer to most asset pricing questions in principle, does not (yet) work well in practice. This observation motivates efforts to tie the discount factor m to other data. Linear factor pricing models are the most popular models of this sort in finance. They dominate discrete-time empirical work.\nFactor pricing models replace the consumption-based expression for marginal utility growth with a linear model of the form\nmt+1 =a+b\u2032ft+1.\na and b are free parameters. As we saw in Chapter 6, this specification is\nequivalent to a multiple-beta model\nE(Rt+1) = \u03b3 + \u03b2\u2032\u03bb,\nwhere \u03b2 are multiple regression coefficients of returns R on the factors f , and \u03b3 and \u03bb are free parameters.\nThe big question is, what should one use for factors ft+1? Factor pricing models look for variables that are good proxies for aggregate marginal utility growth, i.e., variables for which\nu\u2032(ct+1) u\u2032(ct)\nis a sensible and economically interpretable approximation.\nMore directly, the essence of asset pricing is that there are spe- cial states of the world in which investors are especially concerned that their portfolios not do badly. They are willing to trade off some overall performance\u2014average return\u2014to make sure that portfolios do not do badly in these particular states of nature. The factors are variables that indicate\nthat these \u2018\u2018bad states\u2019\u2019 have occurred. 149\n\u03b2\n\u2248 a + b\u2032ft+1 (9.1)",
        "80 5. Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations\nWe can impose this condition rather than estimate \u03b3 in the cross-sectional regression (5.3). If there is no risk-free rate, then \u03b3 must be estimated in the cross-sectional regression. Since it is the expected return of a portfolio with zero betas on all factors, \u03b3 is called the (expected) zero-beta rate in this circumstance.\nWe often examine factor pricing models using excess returns directly. (There is an implicit, though not necessarily justified, division of labor between models of interest rates and models of equity risk premia.) Differencing (5.1) between any two returns R ei = R i \u2212 R j (R j does not have to be risk free), we obtain\nE(Rei)=\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, i=1,2,...,N. (5.4)\nHere, \u03b2ia represents the regression coefficient of the excess return Rei on the factors. This formulation removes the intercept \u03b3 .\nIt is often the case that the factors are also returns or excess returns. For example, the CAPM uses the return on the market portfolio as the single factor. In this case, the model should apply to the factors as well, and this fact allows us to measure the \u03bb coefficients directly rather than via a cross- sectional regression. Each factor has beta of one on itself and zero on all the other factors, of course. Therefore, if the factors are excess returns, we have E(f a) = \u03bba, and so forth. We can then write the factor model as\nE (R ei ) = \u03b2i , a E ( f a ) + \u03b2i , b E ( f b ) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , i = 1, 2, . . . , N . (5.5)\nThe cross-sectional beta pricing model (5.1)--(5.5) and the time-series regression definition of the betas in (5.2) look very similar. It seems that one can take expectations of the time-series regression (5.2) and arrive at the beta model (5.1), in which case the latter would be vacuous since one can always run a regression of anything on anything. The difference is subtle but crucial: the time-series regressions (5.2) will in general have a different intercept ai for each return i, while the intercept \u03b3 is the same for all assets in the beta pricing equation (5.1). The beta pricing equation is a restriction on expected returns, and thus imposes a restriction on intercepts in the time-series regression.\nIn the special case that the factors are themselves excess returns, the restriction is particularly simple: the time-series regression intercepts should all be zero. In this case, we can avoid the cross-sectional regression entirely, since there are no free parameters left."

The payoffs are typically returns or excess returns, including returns scaled by instruments. The prices are typically one (returns), zero (excess returns), or instruments.\nTo implement GMM, we need to choose a set of moments. The obvious set of moments to use are the pricing errors,\ng (b)=ET(xf\u2032b\u2212p). T\nThis choice is natural but not necessary. You do not have to use p = E(mx) with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p = E(mx). You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p = E (mx ). It is a choice, and the results will depend on this choice of moments as well as the specification of the model.\nThe GMM estimate is formed from\nming (b)\u2032Wg (b)\nb\nwith first-order condition\nd\u2032Wg (b)=d\u2032W ET(xf\u2032b\u2212p)=0,\nT\nwhere\nThis is the second-moment matrix of payoffs and factors.

Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe CAPM, credited to Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965a, b), is the first, most famous, and (so far) most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the \u2018\u2018wealth portfolio.\u2019\u2019 The function is linear,\nm =a+bRW . t+1 t+1\na and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1 = E(mRW ) and 1 = E (m )R f . [For example, see equation (8.3).] In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, S&P500, etc.\nThe CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,\n\u0001\u0002\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2 W E(RW)\u2212\u03b3. i,R\nThis section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutility(RW here),andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor.\nI present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by (1) two-period quadratic utility; (2) two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; (3) infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; (4) log utility.",

However, since we want a connection to the beta representation based on covariances rather than second moments, it is easiest to fold means of the factors in to the constant, and write m = a + b \u2032 f with E(f ) = 0 and hence E(m) = a.\nThe connection is easiest to see in the special case that all the test assets are excess returns. Then 0 = E(mRe) does not identify the mean of m, and we can normalize a arbitrarily. I find it convenient to normalize to E (m ) = 1, orm=1+b\u2032[f \u2212E(f)].Then,\n    Beta pricing models are equivalent to linear models for the discount factor m,\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03bb\u2032\u03b2i \u21d4m=a+b\u2032f.\n   using m,x , or R as factors. Let us ask the converse question: suppose we have an expected return-beta model such as CAPM, APT, ICAPM, etc. What discount factor does this model imply? I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work.\nTheorem: Given the model\nm=1+[f \u2212E(f)]\u2032b, 0=E(mRe),\none can find \u03bb such that\nE(Re) = \u03b2\u2032\u03bb,\nwhere \u03b2 are the multiple regression coefficients of excess returns Re on the factors.

Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa.\n6. Given a discount factor, we can also construct a single-beta representa- tion, so expected returns can be described in a single-beta representation using any mean-variance efficient return (except the risk-free rate),\n\u0003\u0004\nE(Ri)=Rf +\u03b2i,mv E(Rmv)\u2212Rf .\nThe essence of the beta pricing model is that, even though the means and standard deviations of returns fill out the space inside the mean- variance frontier, a graph of mean returns versus betas should yield a straight line. Since the beta model applies to every return including Rmv itself, and Rmv has a beta of 1 on itself, we can identify the factor risk premiumas\u03bb=E(Rmv \u2212Rf).\nThe last two points suggest an intimate relationship between discount factors, beta models, and mean-variance frontiers.

One could implement this idea by using a W matrix composed of inverse variances of ET (mt Rt \u22121) on the diagonal. More generally, since asset returns are correlated, one might think of using the covariance matrix of ET (mt Rt \u22121).

        "152 9. Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe CAPM, credited to Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965a, b), is the first, most famous, and (so far) most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the \u2018\u2018wealth portfolio.\u2019\u2019 The function is linear,\nm =a+bRW . t+1 t+1\na and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1 = E(mRW ) and 1 = E (m )R f . [For example, see equation (8.3).] In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, S&P500, etc.\nThe CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,\n\u0001\u0002\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2 W E(RW)\u2212\u03b3. i,R\nThis section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutility(RW here),andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor.\nI present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by (1) two-period quadratic utility; (2) two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; (3) infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; (4) log utility.",

However, since we want a connection to the beta representation based on covariances rather than second moments, it is easiest to fold means of the factors in to the constant, and write m = a + b \u2032 f with E(f ) = 0 and hence E(m) = a.\nThe connection is easiest to see in the special case that all the test assets are excess returns. Then 0 = E(mRe) does not identify the mean of m, and we can normalize a arbitrarily. I find it convenient to normalize to E (m ) = 1, orm=1+b\u2032[f \u2212E(f)].Then,\n    Beta pricing models are equivalent to linear models for the discount factor m,\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03bb\u2032\u03b2i \u21d4m=a+b\u2032f.\n   using m,x , or R as factors. Let us ask the converse question: suppose we have an expected return-beta model such as CAPM, APT, ICAPM, etc. What discount factor does this model imply? I show that an expected return- beta model is equivalent to a discount factor that is a linear function of the factors in the beta model. This is an important and central result. It gives the connection between the discount factor formulation emphasized in this book and the expected return-beta, factor model formulation common in empirical work.\nTheorem: Given the model\nm=1+[f \u2212E(f)]\u2032b, 0=E(mRe),\none can find \u03bb such that\nE(Re) = \u03b2\u2032\u03bb,\nwhere \u03b2 are the multiple regression coefficients of excess returns Re on the factors.

Taking expectations of the time-series regression (14.15) and comparing it to (14.14) (as we did to derive the restriction \u03b1 = 0 for the time-series regression), the restriction \u03b1 = 0 implies\n\u0006\u0007\na =\u03b2\u2032 \u03bb\u2212E(f).

The payoffs are typically returns or excess returns, including returns scaled by instruments. The prices are typically one (returns), zero (excess returns), or instruments.\nTo implement GMM, we need to choose a set of moments. The obvious set of moments to use are the pricing errors,\ng (b)=ET(xf\u2032b\u2212p). T\nThis choice is natural but not necessary. You do not have to use p = E(mx) with GMM, and you do not have to use GMM with p = E(mx). You can use GMM on expected return-beta models, and you can use maximum likeli- hood on p = E (mx ). It is a choice, and the results will depend on this choice of moments as well as the specification of the model.\nThe GMM estimate is formed from\nming (b)\u2032Wg (b)\nb\nwith first-order condition\nd\u2032Wg (b)=d\u2032W ET(xf\u2032b\u2212p)=0,\nT\nwhere\nThis is the second-moment matrix of payoffs and factors.

What could be more sensible? The model (13.1) says that average prices should be a linear function of the second moment of payoff with factors, so the estimate runs a linear regression.

Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations 5.1 Expected Return-Beta Representations\n   The expected return-beta expression of a factor pricing model is E(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\nThe model is equivalent to a restriction that the intercept is the same for all assets in time-series regressions.\nWhen the factors are excess returns, then \u03bba = E ( f a ). If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero, \u03b1 = 0.\n     Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, i=1,2,...,N. (5.1) The \u03b2 terms are defined as the coefficients in a multiple regression of\nreturns on factors,\nRi =a +\u03b2 fa +\u03b2 fb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+\u03b5i, t =1,2,...,T. (5.2)\ntii,ati,bt t\nThis is often called a time-series regression, since one runs a regression over\ntime for each security i. The \u2018\u2018factors\u2019\u2019 f are proxies for marginal utility\ngrowth. I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9.\nFor the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f = consumption\ngrowth, or f = the return on the market portfolio (CAPM). Notice that\nwe run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt\nabout predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in \u2018\u2018good times\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018bad times\u2019\u2019 as measured by the factors.\nThe point of the beta model (5.1) is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i = 1, 2, . . . , N in (5.1) to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in (5.1) are the explanatory (x) variables, which vary asset by asset. The \u03b3 and \u03bb\u2014common for all assets\u2014are the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation (5.1) says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all (E(Ri),\u03b2i) pairs to line up on a straight line with slope \u03bb and intercept \u03b3 .\n\u03b2i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and \u03bba is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure. Read the beta pricing model to say: \u2018\u2018for each unit of exposure \u03b2 to risk factor a, you must provide investors with an expected return premium \u03bba.\u2019\u2019 Assets must give investors higher average returns (low prices) if they pay off well in times",

In the com- mon case W = I , GMM treats all assets symmetrically, and the objective is to minimize the sum of squared pricing errors.\nThesamplepricingerrorg (b)maybeanonlinearfunctionofb.Thus, T\nyou may have to use a numerical search to find the value of b that minimizes the objective in (10.6). However, since the objective is locally quadratic, the search is usually straightforward.\nSecond-Stage Estimates: Why S\u22121?\nWhat weighting matrix should you use? The weighting matrix directs GMM to emphasize some moments or linear combinations of moments at the expense of others. You might start with W = I , i.e., try to price all assets equally well. A W that is not the identity matrix can be used to offset dif- ferences in units between the moments. You might also start with different elementsonthediagonalofW ifyouthinksomeassetsaremoreinteresting, more informative, or better measured than others.\nThe second-stage estimate picks a weighting matrix based on statisti-\ncal considerations. Some asset returns may have much more variance than\nothers. For those assets, the sample mean g = ET (mt Rt \u2212 1) will be a much T\nless accurate measurement of the population mean E (mR \u22121), since the sam- ple mean will vary more from sample to sample. Hence, it seems like a good idea to pay less attention to pricing errors from assets with high variance of mt Rt \u2212 1. One could implement this idea by using a W matrix composed of inverse variances of ET (mt Rt \u22121) on the diagonal. More generally, since asset returns are correlated, one might think of using the covariance matrix of ET (mt Rt \u22121). This weighting matrix pays most attention to linear combinations of moments about which the data set at hand has the most information.

Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe CAPM, credited to Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965a, b), is the first, most famous, and (so far) most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the \u2018\u2018wealth portfolio.\u2019\u2019 The function is linear,\nm =a+bRW . t+1 t+1\na and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1 = E(mRW ) and 1 = E (m )R f . [For example, see equation (8.3).] In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, S&P500, etc.\nThe CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,\n\u0001\u0002\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2 W E(RW)\u2212\u03b3. i,R\nThis section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutility(RW here),andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor.\nI present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by (1) two-period quadratic utility; (2) two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; (3) infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; (4) log utility.",

Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations 5.1 Expected Return-Beta Representations\n   The expected return-beta expression of a factor pricing model is E(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\nThe model is equivalent to a restriction that the intercept is the same for all assets in time-series regressions.\nWhen the factors are excess returns, then \u03bba = E ( f a ). If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero, \u03b1 = 0.\n     Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, i=1,2,...,N. (5.1) The \u03b2 terms are defined as the coefficients in a multiple regression of\nreturns on factors,\nRi =a +\u03b2 fa +\u03b2 fb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+\u03b5i, t =1,2,...,T.

The \u2018\u2018factors\u2019\u2019 f are proxies for marginal utility\ngrowth. I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9.\nFor the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f = consumption\ngrowth, or f = the return on the market portfolio (CAPM). Notice that\nwe run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt\nabout predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in \u2018\u2018good times\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018bad times\u2019\u2019 as measured by the factors.\nThe point of the beta model (5.1) is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i = 1, 2, . . . , N in (5.1) to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in (5.1) are the explanatory (x) variables, which vary asset by asset. The \u03b3 and \u03bb\u2014common for all assets\u2014are the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation (5.1) says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all (E(Ri),\u03b2i) pairs to line up on a straight line with slope \u03bb and intercept \u03b3 .\n\u03b2i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and \u03bba is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure.

The weighting matrix directs GMM to emphasize some moments or linear combinations of moments at the expense of others. You might start with W = I , i.e., try to price all assets equally well.

Some asset returns may have much more variance than\nothers. For those assets, the sample mean g = ET (mt Rt \u2212 1) will be a much T\nless accurate measurement of the population mean E (mR \u22121), since the sam- ple mean will vary more from sample to sample. Hence, it seems like a good idea to pay less attention to pricing errors from assets with high variance of mt Rt \u2212 1. One could implement this idea by using a W matrix composed of inverse variances of ET (mt Rt \u22121) on the diagonal. More generally, since asset returns are correlated, one might think of using the covariance matrix of ET (mt Rt \u22121).

Factor Pricing Models 9.1 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe CAPM, credited to Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965a, b), is the first, most famous, and (so far) most widely used model in asset pricing. It ties the discount factor m to the return on the \u2018\u2018wealth portfolio.\u2019\u2019 The function is linear,\nm =a+bRW . t+1 t+1\na and b are free parameters. One can find theoretical values for the param- eters a and b by requiring the discount factor m to price any two assets, such as the wealth portfolio return and risk-free rate, 1 = E(mRW ) and 1 = E (m )R f . [For example, see equation (8.3).] In empirical applications, we can also pick a and b to best price larger cross sections of assets. We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth. It is conventional to proxy R W by the return on a broad-based stock portfolio such as the value- or equally-weighted NYSE, S&P500, etc.\nThe CAPM is, of course, most frequently stated in equivalent expected return-beta language,\n\u0001\u0002\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2 W E(RW)\u2212\u03b3. i,R\nThis section briefly describes some classic derivations of the CAPM. Again, we need to find assumptions that defend which factors proxy for marginalutility(RW here),andassumptionstodefendthelinearitybetween m and the factor.\nI present several derivations of the same model. Many of these derivations use classic and widely applicable modeling assumptions. You can also see that various sets of assumptions can often be used to get to the same place. By seeing several derivations, you can see how one assumption can be traded for another. For example, the CAPM does not require normal distributions, if one is willing to swallow quadratic utility instead.\n   The CAPM is the model m = a + bRw; Rw = wealth portfolio return. I derive it from the consumption-based model by (1) two-period quadratic utility; (2) two periods, exponential utility, and normal returns; (3) infinite horizon, quadratic utility, and i.i.d. returns; (4) log utility.",
        "78 5. Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations 5.1 Expected Return-Beta Representations\n   The expected return-beta expression of a factor pricing model is E(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\nThe model is equivalent to a restriction that the intercept is the same for all assets in time-series regressions.\nWhen the factors are excess returns, then \u03bba = E ( f a ). If the test assets are also excess returns, then the intercept should be zero, \u03b1 = 0.\n     Much empirical work in finance is cast in terms of expected return-beta representations of linear factor pricing models, of the form\nE(Ri)=\u03b3+\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, i=1,2,...,N. (5.1) The \u03b2 terms are defined as the coefficients in a multiple regression of\nreturns on factors,\nRi =a +\u03b2 fa +\u03b2 fb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+\u03b5i, t =1,2,...,T. (5.2)\ntii,ati,bt t\nThis is often called a time-series regression, since one runs a regression over\ntime for each security i. The \u2018\u2018factors\u2019\u2019 f are proxies for marginal utility\ngrowth. I discuss the stories used to select factors at some length in Chapter 9.\nFor the moment keep in mind the canonical examples, f = consumption\ngrowth, or f = the return on the market portfolio (CAPM). Notice that\nwe run returns R i on contemporaneous factors f j . This regression is not tt\nabout predicting returns from variables seen ahead of time. Its objective is to measure contemporaneous relations or risk exposure: whether returns are typically high in \u2018\u2018good times\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018bad times\u2019\u2019 as measured by the factors.\nThe point of the beta model (5.1) is to explain the variation in aver- age returns across assets. I write i = 1, 2, . . . , N in (5.1) to emphasize this fact. The model says that assets with higher betas should get higher average returns. Thus the betas in (5.1) are the explanatory (x) variables, which vary asset by asset. The \u03b3 and \u03bb\u2014common for all assets\u2014are the intercept and slope in this cross-sectional relation. For example, equation (5.1) says that if we plot expected returns versus betas in a one-factor model, we should expect all (E(Ri),\u03b2i) pairs to line up on a straight line with slope \u03bb and intercept \u03b3 .\n\u03b2i,a isinterpretedastheamountofexposureofassetitofactorarisks, and \u03bba is interpreted as the price of such risk exposure. Read the beta pricing model to say: \u2018\u2018for each unit of exposure \u03b2 to risk factor a, you must provide investors with an expected return premium \u03bba.\u2019\u2019 Assets must give investors higher average returns (low prices) if they pay off well in times",

GMM for Linear Factor Models in Discount Factor Form 13.2 The Case of Excess Returns\n   When mt+1 = a \u2212 b\u2032ft+1 and the test assets are excess returns, the GMM estimate is a GLS cross-sectional regression of average returns on the second moments of returns with factors,\nFirst stage : b\u02c6 = (d\u2032d)\u22121d\u2032E (Re ), 1T\nSecond stage : b\u02c6 = (d\u2032S\u22121d)\u22121d\u2032S\u22121E (Re ), 2T\nwhere d is the covariance matrix between returns and factors. The other formulas are the same.\n     The analysis of the last section requires that at least one asset has a nonzeroprice.Ifallassetsareexcessreturns,thenb\u02c6 =(d\u2032d)\u22121d\u2032E (p)=0.\n1T\nLinear factor models are most often applied to excess returns, so this case is important. The trouble is that in this case the mean discount factor is not identified. If E(mRe ) = 0, then E((2 \u00d7 m)Re ) = 0. Analogously in expected return-beta models, if all test assets are excess returns, then we have no\ninformation on the level of the zero-beta rate.\nWriting out the model as m = a \u2212 b\u2032f , we cannot separately identify\na and b so we have to choose some normalization. The choice is entirely one of convenience; lack of identification means precisely that the pricing errors do not depend on the choice of normalization.\nThe easiest choice is a = 1. Then\ng (b)=\u2212ET(mRe)=\u2212ET(Re)+E(Ref\u2032)b.\nT\n(The \u2212 sign makes the resulting formulas prettier.) We have\n\u2202b\u2032\nthe second-moment matrix of returns and factors.

However, since the objective is locally quadratic, the search is usually straightforward.\nSecond-Stage Estimates: Why S\u22121?\nWhat weighting matrix should you use? The weighting matrix directs GMM to emphasize some moments or linear combinations of moments at the expense of others. You might start with W = I , i.e., try to price all assets equally well. A W that is not the identity matrix can be used to offset dif- ferences in units between the moments. You might also start with different elementsonthediagonalofW ifyouthinksomeassetsaremoreinteresting, more informative, or better measured than others.\nThe second-stage estimate picks a weighting matrix based on statisti-\ncal considerations. Some asset returns may have much more variance than\nothers. For those assets, the sample mean g = ET (mt Rt \u2212 1) will be a much T\nless accurate measurement of the population mean E (mR \u22121), since the sam- ple mean will vary more from sample to sample. Hence, it seems like a good idea to pay less attention to pricing errors from assets with high variance of mt Rt \u2212 1. One could implement this idea by using a W matrix composed of inverse variances of ET (mt Rt \u22121) on the diagonal. More generally, since asset returns are correlated, one might think of using the covariance matrix of ET (mt Rt \u22121). This weighting matrix pays most attention to linear combinations of moments about which the data set at hand has the most information.

Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa.\n6.

However, since we want a connection to the beta representation based on covariances rather than second moments, it is easiest to fold means of the factors in to the constant, and write m = a + b \u2032 f with E(f ) = 0 and hence E(m) = a.\nThe connection is easiest to see in the special case that all the test assets are excess returns.

If a risk-free rate is traded, we can simply observe that it is not infinite and verify the fact. Also, in a complete market, E(m) cannot be zero since, by absence of arbitrage, m > 0. We will see similar special cases in the remaining theorems: the manipulations only work for discount factor choices that do not imply zero or infinite risk-free rates.

        "80 5. Mean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations\nWe can impose this condition rather than estimate \u03b3 in the cross-sectional regression (5.3). If there is no risk-free rate, then \u03b3 must be estimated in the cross-sectional regression. Since it is the expected return of a portfolio with zero betas on all factors, \u03b3 is called the (expected) zero-beta rate in this circumstance.\nWe often examine factor pricing models using excess returns directly. (There is an implicit, though not necessarily justified, division of labor between models of interest rates and models of equity risk premia.) Differencing (5.1) between any two returns R ei = R i \u2212 R j (R j does not have to be risk free), we obtain\nE(Rei)=\u03b2i,a\u03bba +\u03b2i,b\u03bbb +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, i=1,2,...,N. (5.4)\nHere, \u03b2ia represents the regression coefficient of the excess return Rei on the factors. This formulation removes the intercept \u03b3 .\nIt is often the case that the factors are also returns or excess returns. For example, the CAPM uses the return on the market portfolio as the single factor. In this case, the model should apply to the factors as well, and this fact allows us to measure the \u03bb coefficients directly rather than via a cross- sectional regression. Each factor has beta of one on itself and zero on all the other factors, of course. Therefore, if the factors are excess returns, we have E(f a) = \u03bba, and so forth. We can then write the factor model as\nE (R ei ) = \u03b2i , a E ( f a ) + \u03b2i , b E ( f b ) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , i = 1, 2, . . . , N . (5.5)\nThe cross-sectional beta pricing model (5.1)--(5.5) and the time-series regression definition of the betas in (5.2) look very similar. It seems that one can take expectations of the time-series regression (5.2) and arrive at the beta model (5.1), in which case the latter would be vacuous since one can always run a regression of anything on anything. The difference is subtle but crucial: the time-series regressions (5.2) will in general have a different intercept ai for each return i, while the intercept \u03b3 is the same for all assets in the beta pricing equation (5.1). The beta pricing equation is a restriction on expected returns, and thus imposes a restriction on intercepts in the time-series regression.\nIn the special case that the factors are themselves excess returns, the restriction is particularly simple: the time-series regression intercepts should all be zero. In this case, we can avoid the cross-sectional regression entirely, since there are no free parameters left.",

We do not have good data on, or even a good empirical definition for, the return on total wealth.

Given a mean-variance efficient return and the risk-free rate, we can find a discount factor that prices all assets and vice versa.\n6.

What could be more sensible? The model (13.1) says that average prices should be a linear function of the second moment of payoff with factors, so the estimate runs a linear regression. These are cross-sectional regressions since they operate across assets on sample averages.

Maximum Likelihood The factor model, expressed in expected return-beta form, is\nE(Rei)=\u03b1 +\u03b2\u2032\u03bb, i=1,2,...,N. ii\nThe betas are defined from time-series regressions Rei =a +\u03b2\u2032f +\u03b5i.\nThe intercepts ai in the time-series regressions need not be zero, since the model does not apply to the factors. They are not unrestricted, however. Taking expectations of the time-series regression (14.15) and comparing it to (14.14) (as we did to derive the restriction \u03b1 = 0 for the time-series regression), the restriction \u03b1 = 0 implies\n\u0006\u0007\na =\u03b2\u2032 \u03bb\u2212E(f).

        "9\nFactor Pricing Models\nIn Chapter 2, I noted that the consumption-based model, while a complete answer to most asset pricing questions in principle, does not (yet) work well in practice. This observation motivates efforts to tie the discount factor m to other data. Linear factor pricing models are the most popular models of this sort in finance. They dominate discrete-time empirical work.\nFactor pricing models replace the consumption-based expression for marginal utility growth with a linear model of the form\nmt+1 =a+b\u2032ft+1.\na and b are free parameters. As we saw in Chapter 6, this specification is\nequivalent to a multiple-beta model\nE(Rt+1) = \u03b3 + \u03b2\u2032\u03bb,\nwhere \u03b2 are multiple regression coefficients of returns R on the factors f , and \u03b3 and \u03bb are free parameters.\nThe big question is, what should one use for factors ft+1? Factor pricing models look for variables that are good proxies for aggregate marginal utility growth, i.e., variables for which\nu\u2032(ct+1) u\u2032(ct)\nis a sensible and economically interpretable approximation.\nMore directly, the essence of asset pricing is that there are spe- cial states of the world in which investors are especially concerned that their portfolios not do badly. They are willing to trade off some overall performance\u2014average return\u2014to make sure that portfolios do not do badly in these particular states of nature.

GMM for Linear Factor Models in Discount Factor Form 13.2 The Case of Excess Returns\n   When mt+1 = a \u2212 b\u2032ft+1 and the test assets are excess returns, the GMM estimate is a GLS cross-sectional regression of average returns on the second moments of returns with factors,\nFirst stage : b\u02c6 = (d\u2032d)\u22121d\u2032E (Re ), 1T\nSecond stage : b\u02c6 = (d\u2032S\u22121d)\u22121d\u2032S\u22121E (Re ), 2T\nwhere d is the covariance matrix between returns and factors. The other formulas are the same.\n     The analysis of the last section requires that at least one asset has a nonzeroprice.Ifallassetsareexcessreturns,thenb\u02c6 =(d\u2032d)\u22121d\u2032E (p)=0.\n1T\nLinear factor models are most often applied to excess returns, so this case is important. The trouble is that in this case the mean discount factor is not identified. If E(mRe ) = 0, then E((2 \u00d7 m)Re ) = 0. Analogously in expected return-beta models, if all test assets are excess returns, then we have no\ninformation on the level of the zero-beta rate.\nWriting out the model as m = a \u2212 b\u2032f , we cannot separately identify\na and b so we have to choose some normalization. The choice is entirely one of convenience; lack of identification means precisely that the pricing errors do not depend on the choice of normalization.\nThe easiest choice is a = 1. Then\ng (b)=\u2212ET(mRe)=\u2212ET(Re)+E(Ref\u2032)b.\nT\n(The \u2212 sign makes the resulting formulas prettier.) We have\n\u2202b\u2032\nthe second-moment matrix of returns and factors.

        "5\nMean-Variance Frontier and Beta Representations\nMuch empirical work in asset pricing is written in terms of expected return-beta representations and mean-variance frontiers. This chapter introduces expected return-beta representations and mean-variance frontiers.\nI discuss here the beta representation of factor pricing models. Chapters 6 and 9 discuss where the factor models came from. Chapter 6 shows how an expected return-beta model is equivalent to a linear model for the discount factor, i.e., m = b\u2032f . Chapter 9 discusses the derivation of popular factor models such as the CAPM, ICAPM, and APT, i.e., under what assumptions thediscountfactorisalinearfunctionofothervariablesf suchasthemarket return.\nI summarize the classic Lagrangian approach to the mean-variance frontier. I then introduce a powerful and useful representation of the mean- variance frontier due to Hansen and Richard (1987). This representation uses the state-space geometry familiar from the existence theorems. It is also useful because it is valid in infinite-dimensional payoff spaces, which we shall soon encounter when we add conditioning information, dynamic trading, or options.\n 77"
