ABSTRACT
The seminal paper of Crick and Koch (2005) proposed that the claustrum, an enigmatic and thin grey matter
structure that lies beside the insular cortex, may be involved in the processing of consciousness. As a result, this
otherwise obscure structure has received ever-increasing interest in the search for neural correlates of con
sciousness. Here we review theories of consciousness and discuss the possible relationship between the claustrum
and consciousness. We review relevant experimental evidence collected since the Crick and Koch (2005) paper
and consider whether these findings support or contradict their hypothesis. We also explore how future exper
imental work can be designed to clarify how consciousness emerges from neural activity and to understand the
role of the claustrum in consciousness.
Introduction
Consciousness has many components: wakefulness, sentience,
awareness, subjectivity, sensation, the sense of free will, and the exec
utive control of the mind. The definition of consciousness has been a
controversial topic for centuries, with dozens of theories and countless
definitions proposed to explain this complex, yet fascinating, phenom
enon (Sattin et al., 2021). Here we will briefly summarize current con
cepts of consciousness and then consider the possible role of one specific
brain area, the claustrum, in generating consciousness (Crick & Koch,
2005).
Psychology-based definitions of consciousness
While psychologists have diverse perspectives on consciousness, the
most popular theories were proposed by Freud (1915) and Block (1995).
Freud’s Three Levels of Mind posits that our minds constantly perform at
3 hierarchical levels: conscious, preconscious, and unconscious state
(Boag, 2020). According to Freud, the conscious mind contains the
sensation, thoughts, working memory, and information that we are
presently aware of. It allows us to perform logical reasoning, critical
thinking, future planning, and decision-making. The preconscious mind
consists of long-term memory, emotion, and imagination which we are
not presently aware of but can be easily retrieved into awareness. The
unconscious mind is a reservoir of repressed feelings, memories, habits,
and desires that are outside of awareness, yet operative in silence
(Freud, 1915, 1916).
Block (1995) further differentiated the conscious mind into
phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness. Phenomenal con
sciousness results from the perception of sensory experiences such as
hearing, smelling, tasting, and the brain’s interpretation of our present
environment. Access consciousness is a higher-level process that facili
tates reasoning, reflection, and self-awareness which extends beyond the
present and mediates control over our actions and speech.
Without delving too deeply into the philosophy of consciousness,
there is a consensus in cognitive psychology that consciousness has the
following important roles: phenomenal consciousness, namely what a
person subjectively experiences, and access consciousness, which is
what a person can report and act on. Thus, psychologists typically study
consciousness on the basis of such behaviors (i.e., verbal self-reporting
and motor actions). In summary, the shared commonality underlying
many psychological theories is that consciousness consists of subjective
experience (awareness of oneself and the environment) and behavior
(the action influenced by this experience).
Neurology-based definitions of consciousness
From a neurological perspective, consciousness is typically assessed
as a combination of arousal, responsiveness, verbal communication,
brain activity, and purposeful movement. The current neurology-based
consensus is that consciousness exhibits two key features: (1) the state
of consciousness (wakefulness) and (2) the content of consciousness
(awareness) (Zeman, 2006; Bayne et al., 2016; Fazekas & Overgaard,
2016).

Wakefulness describes the quantitative degree of consciousness. In a
clinical or scientific setting, the degree of consciousness is a continuum
of states ranging from full mental alertness and language comprehension
to a complete loss of movement in response to painful stimuli. Aware
ness relates to the qualitative aspects of consciousness, which include
complex cognitive abilities such as attention, sensory perception,
explicit memory, language, and task execution.
Although there are diverse perspectives and approaches to neuro
logical studies of human consciousness, most consider similar compo
nents: (1) waking is the first component in the generation of
consciousness, and (2) being aware of the external environment is the
second component associated with being conscious. Even though
scholars of various disciplines frequently disagree about numerous as
pects of consciousness, virtually all agree that to realize consciousness,
both wakefulness and awareness are required.
Neural correlates of consciousness
In “The feeling of life itself”, Christof Koch (2019) wrote, “Con
sciousness materializes out of the nervous system and endows us with
the ability to be aware, have self-knowledge, and hold beliefs about the
environment and ourselves.” The phenomenon of consciousness arises
from the activity of billions of neurons within our brains. However, the
so-called ‘hard problem’ of how conscious experiences - such as
emotion, thoughts, and perception - could arise from neuronal circuit
interactions is a long-standing puzzle. Many neuroscience-based the
ories seek to explain consciousness in terms of neural activity occurring
within the brain. Here, we summarize three popular theories that
attempt to conceptually explain the neural correlates of consciousness
(NCC).
Global Workspace Theory – The Global Workspace Theory (GWT) was
proposed by Baars (2005). He likened the consciousness contents to a
brightly lit spot on the theater stage, while the rest of the dark theater
remains unconscious. GWT postulates that mental states only become
conscious when they are ‘broadcast’ to a theater within our mind; un
conscious content competes for this spotlight to be broadcast (Baars,
2005; Baars, 2017). Dehaene and Naccache (2001) provided an updated
“neuronal” interpretation of GWT, the Global Neuronal Workspace.
They suggest that conscious cognition emerges from global synchroni
zation, recruitment, and integration involving distributed specialized
networks that are mostly unconscious, a position in line with many
neuroimaging studies. For example, functional magnetic resonance im
aging (fMRI) of the activity of an unconscious brain shows that visual
stimuli tend to activate only local regions, such as the visual cortex,
while conscious cognition is associated with additional widespread
cortical activity, notably toward frontoparietal and medial temporal
lobes (Dehaene & Changeux, 2011; Dehaene et al., 2001; Dehaene et al.,
2003). Therefore, GWT views consciousness as the product of highly
integrated and widespread neural activity.
Integrated Information Theory - The Integrated Information Theory
(IIT) posits that the realization of consciousness relies on the physical
and functional integration of information within the related neuronal
circuitry (Tononi, 2004). Any subjective conscious experience relies on
three domains of neural processing: (1) perception of sensory input from
external and internal stimuli, (2) decision-making and preparation for
actions, and (3) intentional control of thoughts, emotions, motivations,
and actions (Brown et al., 2019; Dehaene & Changeux, 2011; Dehaene &
Naccache, 2001; Raffone & Pantani, 2010; Zeman, 2001). Thus, these
neural domains encode different features of an experience that need to
be integrated to generate a unified and coherent conscious representa
tion of our environment.
Neural Synchrony Theory – The Neural Synchrony Theory (NST)
proposes that the neural substrate of consciousness integrates varying
frequencies of neural oscillations into a coherent pattern within sensory
cortices. This integration binds different and overlapping temporal in
formation into a unitary conscious representation. NST suggests that
neural synchrony, with precision in the millisecond range, may be
crucial for conscious processing (Bastos et al., 2015; Engel & Singer,
2001; Fries, 2015; Varela et al., 2001).
While the mechanisms underlying the GWT, IIT, and NST concepts
seem dissimilar, they all share the same general idea: different domains
of neural information need to interact to support seamless conscious
processing. Thus, NCC-based concepts of consciousness align in sug
gesting that conscious processing is both unifying and integrative. Thus,
the NCC must involve some spatial-temporal integration mechanism
that binds multiple domains of information that would otherwise inde
pendently encode different facets of the same conscious experience.
Given the complexity of such a Herculean task, many wonder if there is a
unitary center of consciousness that efficiently coordinates this task.
Any conscious perception is composed of a multitude of sensory
modalities (e.g., visual, tactile, auditory, olfactory) and sub-modalities
(e.g., color, temperature, motion, pitch). It has long been established
that discrete cortical regions are responsible for specialized cognitive
functions, for example, the visual cortex, auditory cortex, somatosen
sory cortex, motor cortex, etc. Although evidence suggests that our
perceptual processing is distributed across discrete and far-flung
cortices, our perceptions of an experience ultimately become unified.
If the anatomical substrates of perceptual processing are subdivided
into functionally and spatially discrete cortical regions, how are these
independently processed sensory information ultimately get synthesized
into one unified perception? What mechanism mediates the unity of our
experience? Understanding the perceptual cognitive binding - how the
brain "binds" the activity of different neurons together to produce a
coherent representation of the environment – is key to elucidating the
anatomical substrates and neural mechanisms of consciousness.
Claustrum and consciousness
The seminal paper of Crick and Koch (2005) proposed that the
claustrum, an enigmatic and thin grey matter structure that lies beside
the insular cortex, may be the center of consciousness processing. One of
the primary motivations behind their proposal is the extensive and
reciprocal interconnectivity of the claustrum with most of the neocortex,
as well as subcortical structures (Sherk, 1986; Torgerson et al., 2015;
Wang et al., 2017; Zingg et al., 2018; Ham & Augustine, 2022). This is
compatible with a global role for the claustrum in integrating informa
tion across cortices, as required for an area involved in consciousness.
Crick and Koch (2005) proposed that the rhythmic firing of claustral
interneurons synchronizes the activities of far-flung cortical populations
via gap junctions. Vidyasagar and Levichkina (2019) proposed that the
claustrum modulates synchronized neural oscillations between different
cortices via cross-frequency coupling between low-frequency claustral
oscillations with the high-frequency cortical oscillations. Yin et al.
(2016) proposed that the coordination between the claustrum and the
striatum mediates temporal-based processing of multisensory integra
tion within consciousness.
In summary, Crick and Koch (2005) proposed that the claustrum may
be the center of consciousness, and may contain specialized mechanisms
that bind, integrate, and synchronize discrete perceptual, cognitive, and
motor information that gives rise to an apparent unity of consciousness.
They postulated that the claustrum serves as a hub that integrates the
activity of cortical and subcortical neurons to generate a unified and
coherent percept. The claustrum is envisioned as the conductor of an
orchestra made up of multiple cortical and subcortical members. This
metaphor elegantly encapsulates the idea that the claustrum integrates
sensory information about different attributes of a single event - both
within modalities (e.g., visual color and visual depth) and across mo
dalities (e.g., visual depth and audio source) - into a unitary, coherent
conscious percept.
The hypothesis of Crick and Koch (2005) has catalyzed interest in the
claustrum, with a notable increase in the number of claustrum-related
publications in recent years. Here we discuss experimental evidence

published since their paper that either supports or contradicts their
hypothesis. Rather than attempting to cover the fuzzier aspects of con
sciousness (e.g., thought, imagination, motivation, decision-making,
etc.), we will focus on the three most fundamental and agreed-upon
components of consciousness: wakefulness, awareness, and integration.
Claustrum function in wakefulness
Wakefulness is indisputably an integral component of consciousness:
awakening is a prerequisite for other elements of consciousness, such as
awareness, integration, and much more. Thus, wakefulness is a good
place to begin examining the generation of consciousness. Wakefulness
is also a measurable state that can be easily quantified and observed,
both in humans and in laboratory animals. Therefore, a scientific
exploration of consciousness should begin with the awake state.
Clinically, the loss of consciousness (LOC) is defined as an inter
ruption in wakefulness and can often be caused by 3 main reasons:
anesthesia, brain lesion, or sleep. In addition, disruption of conscious
ness is reported to arise from electrical stimulation of the brain. Here we
review evidence from these 4 perspectives that suggest the claustrum
may serve as a neural substrate of consciousness that potentially cor
relates with wakefulness.
Anesthesia-induced unconsciousness - Clinicians routinely use general
anesthesia (GA) to temporarily switch off consciousness. GA causes LOC,
characterized by loss of wakefulness, unawareness, unresponsiveness,
amnesia, and immobility. Anesthetics disrupt functional connectivity
and synchrony between distant cortices by slowing down neural re
sponses (Munglani et al., 1993) or by impairing inter-cortical in
teractions (Mashour, 2004). Thus, anesthetics are believed to interrupt
consciousness by blocking structures that integrate inter-cortical infor
mation (Alkire et al., 2008).
Smith et al. (2017) reported that the functional connections between
the claustrum and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and mediodorsal
thalamus (MD) are significantly weakened during isoflurane-induced
anesthesia. Similarly, Ollerenshaw et al. (2021) have reported that
mouse claustral neurons are silenced during anesthesia. Claustrum
neurons express numerous receptors (i.e., α2 adrenergic, kappa-opioid,
NMDA, dopaminergic, and GABA receptors) that serve as targets for
various anesthetic agents (Chen et al., 2020; Gelegen et al., 2014; Hall
et al., 1996; Meoni et al., 1998; Peckys & Landwehrmeyer, 1999). This
could potentially explain how anesthetic agents terminate wakefulness
via the claustrum. In addition, Pavel et al. (2019) reported that electrical
stimulation in the left anterior claustrum induces a transient deepening
of anesthesia in rats. While this could provide direct evidence of a role
for the claustrum in anesthesia-induced unconsciousness, the small size
of the rodent claustrum makes it difficult to rule out the spread of
stimulating current to neighboring structures, such as the
insula/putamen/striatum.
Taken together, these findings identify functional networks
involving the claustrum that are modified in the anesthetized state,
suggesting – but not proving - a role for the claustrum in anesthesiainduced unconsciousness.
Lesion-induced unconsciousness – Brain lesions frequently cause LOC
and coma in trauma patients and result in the loss of wakefulness, un
awareness, unresponsiveness, amnesia, and immobility. Fischer et al.
(2016) discovered that lesions of the dorsal brainstem are associated
with coma. They reported that the dorsal brainstem is functionally
connected to the anterior insula (AI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
in healthy volunteers but is disconnected in patients suffering from
disorders of consciousness. This finding aligns with the established role
of dorsal brainstem tegmentum in supporting wakefulness and con
sciousness (Hindman et al., 2018; Magoun, 1952; Parvizi & Damasio,
2003). Based on this, Fischer et al. (2016) proposed that the dorsal
brainstem works together with the AI and ACC to drive consciousness.
Additionally, they reported that an fMRI activation node detected in the
AI extends into the claustrum. Given the limited spatial resolution of
fMRI, it is difficult to rule out that the activation node seen in the vicinity
of the AI results partially, or even fully, from claustrum activity. Because
the AI is only sparsely connected to the ACC (Chia et al., 2017), the
claustrum could serve as an intermediary between these two structures.
Its proximity to the insula and dense reciprocal connectivity with the
ACC and insula make the claustrum an ideal candidate for such an
intermediary (Chia et al., 2020).
Snider et al. (2020) reported the activity of the claustrum is anti
correlated with activity in the dorsal brainstem, a region strongly linked
to localized lesions that cause LOC. This suggests that the claustrum may
play a critical role in impacting consciousness. It is possible that cortical
lesions that produce LOC may not map to a single brain region, but
instead represent a network involving the dorsal brainstem and the
claustrum. Nonetheless, the results suggest that the claustrum plays
some role in lesion-induced unconsciousness.
In contrast to the findings above, several other clinical studies report
no causal relationship between claustrum lesions and LOC. Duffau et al.
(2007) observed no long-term sensorimotor or cognitive impairment
and a high rate of full functional recovery in patients with
well-delineated, unilateral surgical removal of the claustrum. Likewise,
claustral lesions do not always cause LOC and LOC is not uniquely
produced by claustral lesions (Chau et al., 2015). Instead, claustral le
sions are associated with an increase in the duration, rather than the
frequency, of LOC.
Collectively, evidence suggests that the claustrum does not have a
crucial and unique role in maintaining wakefulness. It may have some
role in supporting wakefulness that requires participation of other brain
networks. The findings of Duffau et al. (2007) suggest that the function
of each claustrum hemisphere is redundant and can be compensated by
the contralateral claustrum. To understand the unique role of the
claustrum in wakefulness, future research must determine the unique
effects of selective unilateral and bilateral removal (or deactivation) of
the claustrum.
Sleep-induced unconsciousness – During a dreamless sleep, con
sciousness vanishes, and we experience neither wakefulness nor
awareness. While sleep is a different state than anesthesia or coma, brain
awareness and arousal networks are similarly inactivated (Franks, 2008;
Lydic & Baghdoyan, 2005). Because different sleep-wake states are
commonly thought to represent different states of consciousness (Lau
reys, 2005), we will consider the role of the claustrum in regulation of
the sleep-wake cycle.
Given the enriched connectivity between the claustrum and both the
prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the cingulate cortex (Zingg et al., 2018) -
where slow-wave oscillations originate (Massimini et al., 2004; Murphy
et al., 2009; Nir et al., 2011) - the claustrum is a promising candidate for
regulating slow-wave sleep (SWS). Indeed, recent animal studies pro
vide strong support for claustral involvement in sleep processing: the
claustrum has been found to be important for regulation of SWS in
reptiles (Norimoto et al., 2020) and in rodents (Narikiyo et al., 2020).
Narikiyo et al. (2020) also demonstrated that optogenetic activation
of the mouse claustrum induces global silencing of the neocortex. This
suggests that a global synchronization of silent and active states across
the neocortex, via slow-wave activity, could regulate the state of con
sciousness. In addition, patients with claustral lesions exhibit distur
bances in global brain activity, which often leads to seizures (Atilgan
et al., 2022). This fits with a potential role for the claustrum in regu
lating cortical excitability and global synchronization of brain electrical
activity, which could serve as a mechanism for regulating sleep and
wakefulness. Consistent with this concept, patients with claustral lesions
evince sleep disturbances (Meletti et al., 2015; Shintani et al., 2000).
However, it is unclear whether these are solely the result of claustral
lesions or are due to possible confounds, such as medications or con
current damage to other brain regions.
Sleep is regulated by multiple brain structures, many of which are
densely connected to the claustrum (Atilgan et al., 2022). One example
is the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), the main source of serotonergic input
Y.S. Liaw and G.J. Augustine 
International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology 23 (2023) 100405
4
throughout the brain (Monti, 2010, 2011). The claustrum receives
extensive input from raphe neurons (Norimoto et al., 2020; Wong et al.,
2021; Zingg et al., 2018) and the DRN is essential for the initiation and
maintenance of sleep in zebrafish, rats, cats, and mice (Jouvet, 1972;
McGinty & Harper, 1976; Monti, 2010; Oikonomou et al., 2019). The
claustrum also expresses many serotonin receptors (Gehlert et al., 1991;
Koyama et al., 2017; Morales et al., 1998; Norimoto et al., 2020; Wong
et al., 2021). Results from genetic, neurochemical, electrophysiological,
and neuropharmacological studies have suggested that serotonin is
involved in regulation of sleep-wake cycles (Monti, 2011; Ursin, 2002;
Watson et al., 2010). Electrophysiological results have shown that se
rotonin exerts a net inhibitory effect on the claustrum (Wong, 2021;
Wong et al., 2021). Taken together, it is plausible that the claustrum
regulates sleep-wake states via serotonergic inhibitory inputs from the
DRN.
The neocortex and hippocampus are activated during rapid eye
movement (REM) sleep through ascending projections from the claus
trum and the supramammillary nucleus (Renouard et al., 2015).
Following REM sleep, claustral neurons connected to frontal areas (such
as the ACC) exhibit increased expression of Bdnf, FOS, and ARC genes;
these are markers for neural activation and synaptic plasticity, sug
gesting that the claustrum is also more active during REM sleep. This
could indicate a role for the claustrum in REM sleep, though these results
are also consistent with the idea that claustral projections to the
neocortex and hippocampus have a role in memory consolidation or
dreaming, rather than regulating REM sleep per se.
Stimulation of the neocortex (Kuki et al., 2013; Vyazovskiy et al.,
2009) and the thalamus (David et al., 2013) have also been reported to
elicit slow-wave cortical activity in rats. In humans, similar slow-wave
activity can be induced using brain-wide stimulation via transcranial
magnetic stimulation (Massimini et al., 2007). Therefore, the claustrum
may not have unique or global control over SWS. Instead, the claustrum
may function as a component of a sleep-regulatory network that mod
ulates SWS or REM but does not necessarily initiate or inhibit the sleep
rhythm (Norimoto et al., 2020). Further research will be required to
establish the precise role of the claustrum in sleep and wakefulness.
Stimulation-induced alteration in consciousness - The role of the human
claustrum in consciousness has been probed via electrical stimulation.
Koubeissi et al. (2014) reported the remarkable finding that stimulation
near the claustrum of one epilepsy patient elicited a complete and
reversible disruption of consciousness, including arrest of volitional
behavior, unresponsiveness, and amnesia. However, a follow-up study
failed to replicate this finding in five other epilepsy patients whose
claustrum was electrically stimulated, either unilaterally or bilaterally
(Bickel & Parvizi, 2019).
This contradiction probably arises from confounds in the experiment
of Koubeissi et al. (2014). Firstly, it is unclear whether the stimulating
current reached the claustrum; in their experiments, the stimulating
electrode was placed near, but not within, the claustrum. Secondly, the
electrical current applied during stimulation was greater in both
magnitude and duration than that used by Bickel and Parvizi (2019).
Strong stimulation current could potentially flow to cortical neurons,
resulting in direct and widespread cortical silencing that disrupts normal
awareness processing, independent of the claustrum (Atilgan et al.,
2022). Thirdly, the patient had previously undergone an ipsilateral
temporal lobectomy which may have contributed to the observed
disruption of consciousness.
In summary, the predominance of claustral stimulation results do not
support the hypothesis of Crick and Koch (2005). Although it is chal
lenging to assess consciousness in animal models, it would still be useful
to replicate these experiments in mice by using optogenetic approaches
to control claustrum activity more precisely and unambiguously.
Claustrum role in awareness
A second integral component of consciousness is awareness of one’s
self and their surroundings. The perceptual awareness of sensory stimuli
to generate a unified conscious percept, is the foundation of the binding
and integration theory of Crick and Koch (2005). Here we discuss the
potential involvement of the claustrum in awareness: this includes
salience, attention, and altered states of awareness.
Salience and attention - Attention is categorized into 2 distinct path
ways: bottom-up and top-down. Bottom-up attention is passive guidance
of involuntary awareness driven by perceptual salience (i.e., salient
stimuli that possess novel or prominent properties relative to the back
ground). Top-down attention is a voluntary process that directs aware
ness onto information based on internally guided contexts (Katsuki &
Constantinidis, 2014). The content of awareness is highly dependent on
the attended subject (Freud, 1916). Hence, many are convinced that
perceptual salience and attention are prerequisites for awareness and,
thus, consciousness (Cohen et al., 2012; Nani et al., 2019; O’Regan &
No¨e, 2001; Posner, 1994; Sikkens et al., 2019; Simione et al., 2019).
Proposed roles of the claustrum include perceptual salience (Smith
et al., 2019) and attentional modulation (Goll et al., 2015). The claus
trum is hypothesized to detect salient sensory changes and then recruit
the attentional network to process the salient signal. Given the quiescent
nature of claustral neurons and how these neurons respond transiently
to sudden stimuli (Remedios et al., 2014), the claustrum could serve as a
salience detector. Day-Brown et al. (2017) proposed that local
GABAergic circuits normally inhibit claustral activity, which is over
come transiently by excitatory cortico-claustral circuits to signal a
salient stimulus. Such GABAergic circuitry, as well as claustral connec
tivity with sensory and frontal cortices (Goll et al., 2015; Mathur, 2014;
Chia et al., 2020), fit with a possible role for the claustrum in gating
attention.
To date, empirical evidence of a salience detection function for the
claustrum is lacking. The most relevant evidence comes from measure
ment of responses of the macaque claustrum to acoustic stimulation: the
claustrum responds to the onset of sound (Remedios et al., 2014).
Claustrum responses are stronger, with shorter latencies, to novel sound
stimuli with higher signal-to-noise ratio.
Claustral neurons are also more active when rats explore a novel
object in the environment and are significantly less active when the
object is removed (Jankowski & O’Mara, 2015). Claustral activity
dynamically follows the introduction, removal, repositioning, and
location change of the novel object. These neurons are active in both
light and dark conditions, suggesting that the claustrum is co-activated
by both somato-sensory and visual inputs.
Because the claustrum preferentially projects to the ACC (Smith &
Alloway, 2010; Chia et al., 2017; Chia et al., 2020), an area known to be
involved in selective attention (Pardo et al., 1990; Weissman et al.,
2005; Totah et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 2020), the claustrum could
receive top-down attentional influences from the ACC. Indeed, claus
trum neurons can transiently amplify inputs from the ACC (White &
Mathur, 2018). During successful completion of an attentional task, the
activity of ACC neurons projecting to the claustrum is elevated (White
et al., 2018), while optogenetic inhibition of these neurons disrupts
performance accuracy during attentional tasks (White & Mathur, 2018).
In addition, extensive functional connectivity is observed between the
claustrum and the ACC during cognitive tasks (Krimmel et al., 2019).
Therefore, it is plausible that the claustrum and the ACC work together
during an attention-requiring cognitive task.
A role for the claustrum in attention has been more directly sup
ported by several other studies. Claustral inhibition renders mice more
susceptible to auditory distraction and disrupts performance during
maternal pup retrieval and two-alternative-forced-choice task (Atlan
et al., 2018). In addition, optogenetic activation of claustral neurons
decreases cortical responses to pure sound tones, suggesting that
claustrum activity may suppress encoding of task-irrelevant auditory
stimuli (Atlan et al., 2018). This suggests that a subset of claustral
neurons may suppress auditory distractions during attentional tasks.
Partial claustral inactivation results in delayed acquisition of
Y.S. Liaw and G.J. Augustine 
International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology 23 (2023) 100405
5
conditioned motor learning in rabbits (Reus-García et al., 2020). It is
plausible that such inactivation produced deficits in attentional and
salience processing that are required during associative learning,
thereby yielding poorer learning. Further, a subset of claustral neurons
are active in response to combined auditory-somatosensory stimuli, but
not to unimodal, task-irrelevant stimuli (Reus-García et al., 2020).
Because this response pattern lasts only until the completion of condi
tioned motor learning, it is possible that once-salient, task-relevant
stimuli lose their perceptual salience after repeated exposures.
In addition, the claustrum is apparently involved in the formation of
mPFC cell assemblies required for attentional set-shifting. Chemo-ge
netic inhibition of the claustrum disrupts this formation and subsequent
behavioral task accuracy, suggesting that the claustrum-mPFC network
is important for attentional set-shifting (Fodoulian et al., 2020).
On the other hand, chemogenetic activation of the claustrum is re
ported to disrupt attention and significantly attenuate task accuracy
(Liu et al., 2019). This could indicate that the claustrum modulates
attention negatively, though it is also possible that the disruption of
attention results from an abnormal pattern of claustrum activity induced
by the chemogenetic activation.
The ACC has been implicated in complex consciousness, for example
playing a role in the sense of free will (Darby et al., 2018). Crick (1995)
proposed that the ACC is the center of free will. Robust activity is
observed in the ACC and the insular-claustrum region during the sup
pression of blinking, which is a forceful action that relies on free will to
resist the natural urge to blink (Lerner et al., 2008). In this context, the
claustrum-ACC network could be activated by attention to a task and
then recruit circuitry required to maintain eye opening. Thus,
claustrum-related networks could be involved in sub-components of
consciousness, in particular salience or attention.
Altered states of awareness - Conscious awareness can be altered by
psychoactive substances, mental disorders, or mental practices
(Revonsuo et al., 2009; Manuello et al., 2016). During an altered state of
awareness (ASA), an individual experiences a state of awareness that
does not resonate with reality (e.g., hallucinations, delusions, memory
distortions, etc.). Here we review evidence that associates the claustrum
with ASA.
Inhibition of the claustrum, by activating κ-opioid receptors (KOR),
has been proposed to underlie the mind-altering effects of Salvia
divinorum, which is a potent dissociative hallucinogen (Stiefel et al.,
2014). The active ingredient in Salvia divinorum is Salvinorin-A, which is
a KOR agonist. Consistent with this proposal, KOR are densely expressed
in the claustrum (Chen et al., 2020). The claustrum also densely ex
presses serotonin receptors (Wong et al., 2021). Claustral neurons are
activated by a psychedelic compound, 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphet
amine (DOI), which is an agonist of serotonin receptors (Martin &
Nichols, 2016). Another serotonin receptor agonist, psilocybin, is a
hallucinogen that selectively decreases claustral activity without
affecting neighboring structures such as the insula or putamen (Barrett
et al., 2020). Psilocybin induces widespread dysregulation of cortical
activity and alters the functional connectivity between the claustrum
and the default mode network and the frontoparietal task control
network. Hence, ASA could arise from either claustral activation or in
hibition, via differing modes of psychedelic drug action. Much more
work is needed to elucidate the actions of psychedelics on the claustrum
and, more generally, to understand the role of the claustrum in ASA.
Individuals with severe mental disorders, such as schizophrenia,
often experience altered awareness and interpret reality differently. The
volume of the claustrum is smaller in schizophrenic patients (Bernstein
et al., 2016). The hallmark signs of schizophrenia - delusions and hal
lucinations – are associated with a decrease in the intrinsic functional
connectivity between the claustrum and the dorsal ACC (Jacobson
McEwen et al., 2014). Further, the gray matter volumes of the claustrum
and insula are inversely correlated with the severity of delusions and
hallucinations (Cascella et al., 2011). Ishii et al. (2011) have reported
that symmetrical claustral lesions caused by viral encephalitis are
associated with temporary episodes of delusion and hallucinations.
Other studies have similarly reported altered mental states - typically
confusion, disorientation, disordered perception, stupor, delusion, and
hallucination - in patients suffering from claustral lesions (Atilgan et al.,
2022). Schizophrenia is associated with hypersensitivity to non-salient
stimuli (Roiser et al., 2012; Shitij Kapur, 2003) and deficits in sensory
gating (Hall et al., 2010). Supporting the salience-processing role of the
claustrum, Bak et al. (2011) found that activity in the claustrum is linked
to normal sensory gating. It is possible that claustral disruption impairs
normal sensory gating in the brain to filter out irrelevant, non-salient
stimuli to minimize sensory overload. In the case of schizophrenia,
this constant sensory overload may contribute to the psychotic symp
toms (Braff & Geyer, 1990; Patterson et al., 2008).
In summary, although current evidence suggests that the claustrum
is involved in salience and attention, and that modified claustral activity
can alter the integrity of conscious awareness and perception, the pre
cise mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated.
The claustrum and multisensory integration
We experience consciousness as a unified representation, rather than
discrete perceptions of sight, sound, smell, emotion, etc. The claustrum
receives afferent inputs from many sensory cortices, motivating the
integrative theory of Crick and Koch (2005). Further, Smith and
Alloway (2014) have suggested that the claustrum is engaged when
multisensory stimuli are perceived altogether and when multisensory
integration is required for behavior. Such ideas are consistent with ob
servations that single-mode, task-irrelevant stimuli rarely activate the
claustrum, while claustral activity is increased by presentation of
multisensory stimuli (e.g., paired auditory and tactile stimuli) (ReusGarcía et al., 2020). Similarly, the claustrum is minimally responsive
towards passive sensory representation but strongly responsive during
behavior that requires sensory-motor integration (Ollerenshaw et al.,
2021).
The rat claustrum is involved in interhemispheric coordination of the
primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices during whisking
and exploratory behavior, suggesting that it plays a role in coordinating
sensory-motor cortical activity across hemispheres (Smith et al., 2012).
Furthermore, a subset of rat claustral neurons selectively respond to
spatial location, boundaries enclosing a space, and to novel objects, both
in light or dark conditions (Jankowski & O’Mara, 2015). This suggests
that the claustrum could concurrently respond to multisensory stimuli
(i.e., tactile and visual). Collectively, these findings support a role for the
claustrum in integrating multisensory information, primarily during
cognitive attention and sensory-motor integration.
However, there is evidence arguing against this hypothesis. In the
macaque claustrum, individual claustral neurons reportedly respond to
either auditory or visual stimuli, but not to both (Remedios et al., 2010).
Because the response to one modality was not modulated by another
modality, this suggests the lack of multisensory integration within the
claustrum. Further, while the rat claustrum projects to both S1 and M1,
the S1 does not project back to it (Smith et al., 2012). Thus, the claus
trum is unlikely to be the integrator for somatosensory and motor
cortical information. In summary, while these findings indicate the
multisensory nature of the claustrum, they argue against a multisensory
integrator role for the claustrum.
To reconcile the conflicting experimental evidence regarding
multimodal integration within the claustrum, Smythies et al. (2014)
proposed that when connected cortical areas involved in the same task
begin to synchronize their activities, their connections to the claustrum
generate intra-claustral neural synchrony. The claustra then enhance the
synchrony between these connected cortical areas through their effer
ents back to the respective cortical targets. While speculative, this hy
pothesis can reconcile existing experimental data and warrants further
investigation.
Taken together, these findings support the theory for the claustrum

to process sensory-motor representations, as well as to coordinate multisensory activity required in cognitive attention and sensory-motor tasks.
However, they argue against a central integrative function because those
representations do not appear to be integrated within the claustrum.
Therefore, current information does not definitively validate or disprove
a role for the claustrum as an integrator for consciousness.
Is the claustrum involved in consciousness?
Although our understanding of the neural substrates of conscious
ness is expanding, it remains imprecise (Lenharo, 2023). The previous
sections describe evidence suggesting that the claustrum may play roles
in wakefulness, awareness, and integration. These are consistent with a
role for the claustrum in consciousness. However, many other brain
areas beyond the claustrum undoubtedly also are involved in con
sciousness. Among sub-cortical structures, the thalamus, basal ganglia,
and hippocampus are most often implicated, whereas the cingulate,
prefrontal, and temporal areas are the most relevant cortical structures
(Sattin et al., 2021).
A traditional view is that consciousness is supported by the neurons
within the ascending reticular activation system (ARAS), which plays a
crucial role in sustaining arousal and wakefulness (Englot et al., 2017;
Jang & Lee, 2015; Jones, 2003). The paraventricular nucleus of the
thalamus (PVT) has also been identified as a key node for controlling the
state of awakening and arousal (Groenewegen & Berendse, 1994; Ishi
bashi et al., 2005; Kirouac, 2015; Nascimento et al., 2008; Ohno &
Sakurai, 2008; Van der Werf et al., 2002). The claustrum is known to
map to nuclei affecting sleep and sustaining wakefulness, such as the
DRN (Norimoto et al., 2020), PVT (Zingg et al., 2018), and possibly
ARAS (Fischer et al., 2016). However, while wakefulness sustained by
ARAS and PVT is necessary, wakefulness alone is insufficient for
conscious awareness.
Awareness is thought to arise within the neocortex. Conscious
awareness may emerge from the frontal lobe, including the prefrontal
and central anterior cortex (Blake & Logothetis, 2002; Breitmeyer &
Ogmen, 2000; Francis, 2000; Imamoglu et al., 2012; Tsuchiya & Koch,
2005). Alternatively, it could arise in the hindbrain, including the
occipital/parietal and central posterior cortical regions (Bianchi &
Sims, 2008; Boly et al., 2017; Koch et al., 2016; Merker, 2007; Seth,
2018). Experimental results are often contradictory, likely due to dif
ferences in techniques used. Classic report-based paradigms reveal
broad fronto-parietal cortical activation during visual–motor tasks that
contrast perceived versus unperceived stimuli (Dehaene & Changeux,
2011). However, this may reflect processes that are merely a prerequi
site for conscious awareness — such as vigilance, attention, expectation,
task preparation, and reporting — rather than the conscious experience
itself (Aru et al., 2012; de Graaf et al., 2012; Koivisto & Revonsuo, 2010;
Miller, 2014). Newer no-report paradigms (Tsuchiya et al., 2015), which
do not require subjects to produce an overt report, identify a more
restricted and consciousness content-specific activation in the posterior
cortical areas (Fr¨
assle et al., 2014).
It is likely that consciousness requires multiple components working
together seamlessly; this includes cooperation between multiple cortical
and subcortical regions, each of which serves as an island of con
sciousness. Elaborating on the conductor metaphor (Crick & Koch,
2005), it appears that the orchestra requires several conductors that
work together to support and manage consciousness. If this is the case, it
will be important to identify the mechanisms or structures responsible
for such coordination (Bayne et al., 2020). The relationship between the
claustrum and these consciousness-related areas is unclear. Evidence
summarized here indicates that the claustrum participates in large-scale
networks that subserve functions such as wakefulness, sleep, and
attention. These are important components of consciousness. The
claustrum is also hypothesized to mediate synchronization and modu
lation of cortical functional networks to integrate and unify our
conscious percept.
The claustrum is often implicated in selective attention (Goll et al.,
2015) and projects to the ACC, a structure known to be involved in
attention (Chia et al., 2017; Krimmel et al., 2019; White & Mathur,
2018; White et al., 2018). Because attention strongly influences our
conscious awareness, perhaps the claustrum contributes to conscious
ness merely as an attentional hub. In this role, it would redirect atten
tional traffic across the neocortex and retrieve memories into conscious
awareness.
Recently, Budson et al. (2022) proposed an alternative theory based
on the concept that we do not experience our perceptions directly, but
instead experience them by recalling a memory of our perceptions. Ac
cording to this theory, a majority of our decisions and actions happen
unconsciously; our awareness of these decisions and actions only occurs
later, in the form of recalling a memory. This aligns with observations of
sensorimotor systems in the primate brain that function in the absence of
consciousness, termed the “zombie mode” by Koch and Crick (2001).
These are stereotypical, routine, rapid, and effortless actions that out
pace consciousness. This is particularly true of the highly practiced and
ritualized sensorimotor activities, such as playing musical instruments,
using sports skills, or dancing. We become conscious of the actions of our
zombies, but usually only retrospectively by remembering our actions.
A prime example of zombie-mode behavior is sleepwalking. A
sleepwalker is neither awake nor aware (Jacobson et al., 1965; Schenck
et al., 1998; Zadra et al., 2004), yet can carry out complex movements
such as talking, walking, eating, cleaning, cooking, and even driving a
vehicle (Popat & Winslade, 2015). Sleepwalkers are not conscious,
because they neither experience sensory perception nor have any
memory of the incident. Not only does this challenge our deep-seated
belief that consciousness is necessary for performing complex
behavior, but it also reveals how our locomotor control system can be
automated and dissociated from our consciousness during sleep and
waking state (Kannape et al., 2017). Further, the onset of cerebral ac
tivity for a voluntary motor act precedes the conscious intention to act
by several hundred milliseconds, challenging the initial assumption that
conscious urge is needed to initiate a voluntary act (Libet et al., 1983).
This suggests that cerebral initiation of a voluntary movement can begin
unconsciously before there is any awareness about the intention to act.
Koch and Crick (2001) proposed that consciousness arises to create

explicit memory and to plan future actions, opening a potentially
infinite behavioral repertoire. Budson et al. (2022) proposed that con
sciousness enables us to store, recall and recombine memories to guide
future actions. Thus, our conscious percept could be a creative combi
nation of sensory memory, working memory, episodic memory, se
mantic memory, etc.
It has long been established that discrete cortical regions are
responsible for specialized cognitive functions. Budson et al. (2022)
suggests that each cortex autonomously behaves like an island of con
sciousness. Each cortex contributes to the formation of sensory or
working memory within its specialized domain (Fig. 1). For example,
(A) motor cortex processes awareness awareness and memory of motor
action, (B) prefrontal cortex processes working memory; (C) Broca’s
area processes awareness and memory of speech, (D) somatosensory
cortex processes awareness and memory of somatic information, (E)
auditory cortex processes auditory awareness and memory, and (F) vi
sual cortex processes visual awareness & memory.
Given its tiny size, small number of neurons, and quiescent nature, it
is unlikely that the claustrum has sufficient computational bandwidth to
enable the continuous stream of information processing associated with
consciousness. Coordinating and redirecting “attentional traffic” toward
memories across islands of consciousness may be better suited to the
computational capacity of the claustrum. If memories are packaged and
stored as readily accessible units within cortical islands, then retrieving
the memories would be simpler and faster than constantly integrating
new information. Rather than integrating and synthesizing new content,
a claustrum-mediated attentional network could simply retrieve a
memory and bring it into conscious awareness. Rather than perceiving
the world and our actions in real time, such a system would let us
remember our perceptions and actions in retrospect.
The claustrum has also been implicated in REM sleep (Fenk et al.,
2023; Renouard et al., 2015), which has been hypothesized to consoli
date memory (Boyce et al., 2017). When multiple sensory and working
memories are repeatedly accessed together, they could be consolidated
and woven into a bundled and time-stamped unit during REM sleep.
These bundles could then be stored as long-term episodic memory,
procedural memory, or semantic memory and could be easily retrievable
via a claustrum-mediated attentional network.
Such a consciousness-enabling memory system could potentially
explain the apparent unity of consciousness. The claustrum is wellconnected to the ACC (attention), PFC (working memory), sensory
cortices (sensory memory), motor cortex (motor/procedural memory),
amygdala (fear-related memory), hippocampus (spatial/episodic mem
ory), entorhinal cortex (episodic/contextual memory), and retrosplenial
cortex (spatial memory) (Atlan et al., 2017; Brennan et al., 2021;
Jackson et al., 2020; Kitanishi & Matsuo, 2017; Miller et al., 2014;
Mitchell et al., 2018; Torgerson et al., 2015; Zingg et al., 2018). Via such
extensive connectivity, the claustral projections could simultaneously
retrieve memory units from many cortical islands. When memory units
that correspond to multiple facets of a singular event (e.g., visual, audio,
and scent memories) concurrently enter the conscious awareness, it
could appear as a unified representation.
Challenges, limitations, and future directions
Understanding consciousness is a complex problem. Our limited
current knowledge of consciousness makes it difficult to consolidate all
perspectives. There are many definitions of consciousness, a multitude
of viewpoints, and multifaceted approaches to studying consciousness.
Many aspects of consciousness remain subjective. For example, are
anesthesia and sleep the same form of unconsciousness? Assessment is
often controversial because aspects of consciousness are difficult to
quantify, e.g., are we directly measuring the degree of consciousness or
indirectly observing a consciousness-related phenomenon? Because
consciousness is not accessible to outsiders, researchers typically rely on
self-reporting to assess the degree of consciousness. These “measures” of
consciousness vary considerably from individual to individual, trial to
trial, and study to study. An important direction for future research will
be to develop a more objective measure of consciousness in humans.
The synthesis of knowledge about relationships between the claus
trum and consciousness is complicated by several factors, including (1)
the relative scarcity of studies that focus on the claustrum, (2) the lack of
spatial resolution in fMRI to unmistakeably delineate the claustrum from
neighboring structures and to disentangle claustrum activity from that
of neighboring areas, such as the insula and striatum; and (3) the lack of
a clear understanding of the general role of the claustrum in behavior. As
mentioned earlier, there is an upward trajectory in the amount of
claustrum-related research, so we are hopeful that factor (1) will be
overcome in the foreseeable future. This, in turn, will enable better
understanding of claustral function (factor 3). Factor (2) will require
greater use of 7T MRI instruments (Krimmel et al., 2019) and better
segmentation algorithms (Li et al., 2021).
Furthermore, clinical results related to claustrum function are
confusing and inconsistent: diverse signs and symptoms have been re
ported in response to claustrum dysfunction or experimental stimula
tion. Patients experience varying levels and types of disturbance in
cognitive function, perceptual abilities, mental state, electrical activity,
or sleep. This is further complicated by the fact that bilateral lesions that
are restricted to the claustrum are exceedingly rare; lesions in this area
typically include damage to the surrounding white matter. Often, uni
lateral claustral lesions occur and studies do not account for possible
compensatory functions of the other claustrum. As mentioned previ
ously, understanding the role of the claustrum in wakefulness requires
elucidation of the effects of selective unilateral and bilateral removal (or
deactivation) of the claustrum. In sum, more carefully controlled clinical
research into claustrum function is warranted.
In order to understand the role of claustrum in awareness, future
research could aim to clarify how the claustrum mediates sensory gating
and modulates attentional switching, to prevent sensory overload in
schizophrenic patients versus healthy subjects. In addition, to under
stand the role of the claustrum in altered awareness more work will need
to be done to determine the actions of psychedelic agents on the
claustrum.
To date, claustrum stimulation studies of consciousness have largely
been done in humans. Although it is challenging to assess consciousness
in animal models, it would still be useful to replicate such claustral
stimulation experiments in mice by using optogenetic approaches to
control claustrum activity more precisely and unambiguously.
The main limitation of studying claustrum function in animal models
is the small size, irregular shape, and anatomical location of the claus
trum. These anatomical constraints make precise surgical removal and
pharmacological intervention extremely difficult. Even with state-ofthe-art technology, such as optogenetics (Mahmoudi et al., 2017) and
chemogenetics (Campbell & Marchant, 2018), in vivo functional
manipulation and specific targeting of claustral neurons remain arduous
tasks. While there has been progress in identifying genetic markers that
allow semi-selective expression of transgenes in claustral neurons but
not in adjacent regions (Mathur et al., 2009; Watakabe, 2017; Watakabe
et al., 2014), currently there is no gene promoter known that is entirely
selective for claustrum neurons. Such refinements should be paired with
rigorous optimization of positioning when using imaging, measurement,
and manipulating tools. Further, to take advantage of such improve
ments in manipulating the claustrum of animal models, it will be crucial
to develop an experimental paradigm for assessing consciousness in
animal models.
Understanding the role of claustrum in integration might benefit
from the alternative theory of consciousness-enabling memory system.
The claustrum could act as a hub to redirect attentional traffic across
various cortical islands and retrieve consciousness-related content in the
form of memories. Testing this theory will require analysis of how
memories are processed in various cortical regions and determining
whether claustral projections have access to these memories. Thus,

future research should aim to elucidate the relationship between the
claustrum and brain structures that are involved in memory formation,
retrieval, and consolidation.
Finally, if the claustrum is indeed integrating information both
within and across modalities, it is unlikely that bilateral claustral
silencing would interfere with “zombie mode” sensory-motor behaviors,
such as instinctual, routine, and stereotyped behaviors evoked by basic
sensory input. To circumvent such complications, future behavioral
analyses of claustrum function should be based on tasks with higher
cognitive workload (e.g., involving multisensory stimuli within or across
modalities).
Conclusions
The hypothesis of Crick and Koch (2005) has catalyzed interest in the
claustrum in the search for neural correlates of consciousness. We have
summarized theories of consciousness, reviewed the relationship be
tween the claustrum and consciousness, and examined experimental
evidence that either supports or contradicts the hypothesis that the
claustrum is the seat of consciousness. We have also explored an alter
native theory about consciousness and discussed how future experi
ments could investigate the role of the claustrum in consciousness.
Given what we now know, the most parsimonious explanation is that
the claustrum serves as a structural interface between awakening,
awareness, and integration, the 3 fundamental components of con
sciousness. The key roles of the ARAS and PVT in arousal and awakening
could enable consciousness, with cortical islands serving as storage sites
for awareness content, while the claustrum may be responsible for
retrieval of such content across various cortical islands (Fig. 2). To
determine how the claustrum could coordinate this collection of brain
areas subserving different functions, further experiments certainly will
be needed.
We hope that this review will inspire future research that explores
claustral function from a perspective that clarifies the relationship be
tween the claustrum and brain structures typically involved in memory
formation, retrieval, and consolidation, as well as the relationship be
tween the claustrum and structures involved in sleep, arousal, and
wakefulness.
