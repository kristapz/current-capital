Ensure that each relevant field in the JSON structure is populated with relevant information from the 10-K report's Item 1A. If certain information is not available or not applicable, the section should not be included.
Guidelines for completing each section:
1. riskOverview: Provide a summary of the risk factors disclosed, including total count and categories.
2. marketAndIndustryRisks through macroeconomicRisks: For each risk category, list individual risks with descriptions, potential impacts, and any mentioned mitigation efforts.
3. riskInterconnections: Highlight any interconnected risks and their potential compounding effects.
4. riskManagementApproach: Summarize the company's overall approach to risk management.
5. forwardLookingStatements: Note any cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements.
6. analystAssessment: Offer your professional opinion on the comprehensiveness of the risk disclosure, identify the most critical risks, point out any potentially understated risks, assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, provide an overall risk profile, and offer recommendations for investors.
Base your analysis solely on the information provided in the 10-K report. Maintain objectivity and provide a balanced assessment of the company's risk factors. If you need to make any inferences or interpretations, clearly state them as such. Remember to focus on material information that could have a significant impact on investor decision-making.
